QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2025-02-05\\nTitle: Resource-Efficient & Effective Code Summarization\\nAuthors: Saima Afrin, Joseph Call, Khai-Nguyen Nguyen, Oscar Chaparro, Antonio Mastropaolo\\nSummary: Code Language Models (CLMs) have demonstrated high effectiveness in\\nautomating software engineering tasks such as bug fixing, code generation, and\\ncode documentation.

      "[AIMessage(content=\"NelNet's repeated failure to process auto-debit payments, despite confirmation, can be concerning from a borrower rights perspective. Auto-debit payments are designed to ensure timely and accurate loan repayment, and borrowers have the right to expect that their payment instructions will be honored unless specific conditions, such as deferment or forbearance, are in place. When auto-debit fails without valid reason, it can lead to missed payments, potential credit damage, and increased borrower stress.\\n\\nFrom a legal standpoint, borrowers have the right to clear and accurate information about their repayment options and the expectation that their payments will be processed as agreed. Failures to process payments could potentially violate these rights, especially if they result in negative credit reporting or other adverse effects.\\n\\nRegarding privacy laws, auto-debit arrangements involve sensitive financial information. If NelNet's failure to process payments is related to mishandling or unauthorized access to borrower data, it could raise concerns about compliance with privacy laws such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act or other data protection regulations. However, based on the available information, the issue appears to be more related to processing errors rather than privacy violations.\\n\\nIn summary, NelNet's failure to process auto-debit payments despite confirmation may infringe on borrower rights related to fair treatment and accurate information. If these failures are due to systemic issues or mishandling of data, they could also raise privacy concerns.
