In a standard term or nonstandard term academic calendar, a term is generally a period in which all classes are scheduled to begin and end within a set time frame, and academic progress is measured in credit hours. In a non-term academic calendar, classes do not begin and end within a set time frame, such as a term. Academic progress in a non-term program can be measured in either credit or clock hours. In some cases (as discussed below), a program with terms must be treated as a non-term program for Title IV purposes. A subscription-based academic calendar is used only by subscription-based programs. A subscription-based program is a term-based program in which the school charges a student for each term on a subscription basis with the expectation that the student will complete a specified number of credit hours (or the equivalent) during that term. However, classes in a subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term, as is the case in a term-based calendar that is not subscription-based. For more detail on subscription-based programs, see Volume 2, Chapter 2. A subscription-based academic calendar consists of ""subscription periods"" that are either standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms (for guidance on when terms are considered to be substantially equal in length, see <Payment periods for programs using standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms= later in this chapter). Substantially equal nonstandard terms may be of any length, but if they are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for purposes of monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6 for more information on BBAY 3). Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length are not permissible in a subscription-based academic calendar. The term ""subscription period"" is synonymous with ""term"" and ""payment period"" (payment periods are covered later in this chapter). Except for the fact that classes are not required to start and end within a term, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs. These requirements include: minimum and maximum term length restrictions for standard terms (see the discussion in the next section of this chapter); requirements for determining full-time enrollment (see Volume 1, Chapter 1); use of a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY), BBAY 1, BBAY 2, or BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6); and use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards (see Volume 7, Chapter 4). Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. Standard Terms: Semesters, Trimesters, and Quarters Semesters and trimesters contain between 14 and 21 weeks of instructional time. However, a summer term in a program using semesters or trimesters may contain fewer than 14 weeks. An academic calendar that uses semesters or trimesters traditionally has three terms, one each in the fall, spring, and summer, two of which comprise an academic year. For example, in a program using an SAY calendar, fall and spring would comprise an academic year. In a program using a']","The structure of an academic calendar—such as standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based—significantly influences the calculation and disbursement of Pell Grant awards. Here's how each structure impacts the process:

1. Term Definition and Scheduling:
   - Standard and Nonstandard Terms: These are scheduled periods with fixed start and end dates, typically measured in credit hours and weeks of instruction. Pell Grants are calculated based on these defined terms, with specific rules for each.
   - Non-term Programs: Classes are not confined to fixed periods, and progress may be measured in hours without specific calendar dates. This can complicate Pell Grant calculations, which often rely on defined terms.
   - Subscription-based Programs: These are term-based but charge students on a subscription basis, with ""subscription periods"" that may be standard or nonstandard. Classes are not required to start and end within specific timeframes, adding flexibility to scheduling.

2. Impact on Pell Grant Formulas:
   - Term-based programs (standard or nonstandard) align Pell Grant calculations with scheduled award periods, considering the length of terms and weeks of instruction.
   - Non-term or non-standard calendars may require alternative calculations due to the lack of fixed scheduling.
   - Subscription-based programs follow similar rules but may have more flexible scheduling, affecting disbursement timing and amounts.

3. Disbursement Timing:
   - Disbursements are tied to payment periods based on the academic calendar structure.
   - In standard terms, disbursements align with scheduled start and end dates.
   - In subscription-based or non-term programs, disbursements may be based on subscription periods, which may not align with traditional calendar dates, potentially affecting when students receive aid.

4. Monitoring and Eligibility:
   - The calendar structure influences how schools monitor full-time enrollment, academic progress, and specific monitoring periods (e.g., SAY, BBAY 1, BBAY 2, BBAY 3).
   - Subscription-based programs use similar rules but adapt to flexible scheduling.

5. Special Considerations:
   - Non-standard or non-term calendars may require special treatment for crossover Pell awards and the calculation of the academic year, especially if hours completed do not match weeks of instruction.
   - The structure determines whether the program qualifies as a term-based program eligible for standard Pell formulas or requires alternative calculations.

In summary, traditional term-based calendars facilitate straightforward Pell Grant calculations and disbursements, while non-term and subscription-based calendars introduce flexibility that can complicate these processes. Schools must adhere to specific regulatory rules to ensure proper award calculation and timely disbursement.","The structure of an academic calendar—whether it is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based—affects how Pell Grant awards are calculated and disbursed. In subscription-based programs, which are term-based but do not require classes to start and end within a specific timeframe, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply. This includes the use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards. The type of academic calendar determines the applicable Pell Grant formula and the timing of aid disbursement under Title IV programs.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
"medicine program clinical work, it gotta be in standard term or not?",[],"['Inclusion of Clinical Work in a Standard Term Periods of medical and education program clinical work which is conducted outside the classroom may not be included in a standard term, unless all of the following apply: All students in the program must participate in the practicum or clinical experience, and they must be required to complete the practicum or clinical experience as a condition for applying for licensure or authorization to practice the occupation they intend to pursue; The school has little or no control over the length or starting and ending dates of the practicum or clinical experience. This may be due to constraints imposed by outside licensing bodies or the need to accommodate schedules of entities with which students are being placed (e.g., school districts or hospitals); and Credit hours associated with the practicum or clinical experience must be associated with the term in which most of the training occurs, even if the starting and ending dates do not exactly align with the term dates and/or overlap with another term. If the clinical work meets all the above criteria, terms which include such clinical work are not required to be considered nonstandard, nor are such programs required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. This flexibility is limited to required clinical periods associated with standard term programs in medicine (including, but not limited to, allopathic, osteopathic, nursing, veterinary, dentistry, pharmacy, and physical therapy), and student teaching required to obtain a state teaching certificate. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for additional guidance on certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets the criteria described above is included in a standard term. Nonstandard Terms Generally, nonstandard terms are terms that are not semesters, trimesters, or quarters. For example, a 5-week term or a 23-week term would be considered a nonstandard term because no standard term can be fewer than nine weeks or greater than 21 weeks in length. Like standard terms, nonstandard terms may be equal in length or may be of different lengths. If a program is offered in a combination of standard terms and nonstandard terms, the program is considered to be offered in nonstandard terms. Also, like standard terms, nonstandard terms may not overlap within a program. Even if a school calls its terms semesters, trimesters, or quarters, they are considered to be nonstandard terms if they do not comply with the policy on standard term length, as described earlier. For instance, a 22-week semester or an 8-week quarter must be treated as a nonstandard term, because a semester cannot contain more than 21 weeks and a quarter must include a minimum of nine weeks. Semesters, trimesters, or quarters are also considered to be nonstandard terms if academic progress is not measured in the manner normally associated with the type of term. For example, if a program is offered in 15-week semesters but measures academic progress in quarter credit hours, the semesters would be considered nonstandard terms.']",Could you please clarify your question a bit more? Are you asking whether clinical work in a medicine program needs to be documented or described using standard medical terminology? Or are you referring to the requirements for clinical work in a specific medicine program? Providing more details will help me give you a more accurate answer.,"If the clinical work in a medicine program meets all the criteria listed—like all students must do it, it's required for licensure, the school don't control the dates, and the credit hours go with the term where most training happens—then terms with that clinical work don't gotta be considered nonstandard, even if the clinical work overlaps another term.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer

Effect of Accelerated Progression on Disbursement Timing in a Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Program The Pell Grant or TEACH Grant amount that a student is eligible to receive for a payment period in a clock-hour or non- term credit-hour program is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods for the program that are established at the beginning of the program based on the program length (as described earlier in this chapter). These scheduled payment periods do not change, regardless of a student9s rate of progression through a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program. This means that if a student completes additional weeks of instructional time or hours while completing the other measure of a payment period, the actual number of weeks or hours that the student completes before a disbursement can be made for the next payment period may differ from the number of weeks or hours in the scheduled payment period used to determine the student9s grant amount for the payment period. Although a student9s completion of additional weeks or hours in a payment period has no effect on the scheduled payment periods for purposes of determining Pell Grant and TEACH Grant payment amounts, an undergraduate student who accelerates in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year of a program. Specifically, if a student enrolled in a program that is greater than one academic year in length completes additional clock or credit hours prior to the final academic year of the program, this may result in a final period of study that contains fewer clock or credit hours than the number of hours in the program9s defined academic year. In this circumstance, the Direct Loan annual loan limit for an undergraduate student must be prorated (reduced). The principles described above are illustrated by the examples in Appendix A at the end of this chapter.

Multiple Disbursements Within a Payment Period The regulations governing the Title IV programs generally permit schools to pay Title IV funds at such times and in such installments within each payment period as will best meet students9 needs. This gives schools the ability to apportion the payment if doing so will be in the best interest of the student. For example, if a payment period is particularly long, a school might choose to pay in multiple installments to the extent program requirements permit to ensure that a student will have funds to pay rent later in the payment period. If a school chooses to schedule multiple Direct Loan disbursements within a single payment period, the disbursements must be substantially equal. Note also that if the loan period for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless the school qualifies for an exception to the multiple disbursement requirement. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more']","The disbursement timing for federal student aid varies between clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs and subscription-based programs, with specific requirements for each.

**Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Programs:**
- Disbursements are linked to the successful completion of specific measures within each payment period, based on clock hours and instructional weeks.
- For programs one academic year or less, the first payment period begins after the student completes half of the clock hours and weeks of instruction. Subsequent disbursements follow the completion of the remaining hours and weeks.
- For programs longer than one academic year, each academic year follows the same rule: disbursements occur after completing half of the hours and weeks, then the remainder.
- Before receiving subsequent disbursements, students must have successfully completed the required hours and weeks in the current payment period.
- Accelerated progression (completing additional hours or weeks early) may affect the final year's loan limits, potentially reducing eligibility.

**Subscription-Based Programs:**
- For the first two subscription periods, there is no coursework completion requirement before disbursement.
- For subsequent periods, students must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total hours enrolled in all previous periods, excluding the most recent.
- Disbursements depend on the student having completed the necessary cumulative coursework from prior periods.

**Specific Requirements for Subsequent Disbursements:**
- **Clock-Hour or Non-Term Programs:** Successful completion of the required hours and weeks in the current payment period.
- **Subscription-Based Programs:** Completion of the cumulative credit hours from all previous subscription periods (excluding the most recent).

In summary, clock-hour and non-term programs require successful completion of instructional hours and weeks before disbursing subsequent aid, while subscription-based programs require cumulative coursework completion from prior periods.","In clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs, students must complete both the required credit or clock hours and the weeks of instructional time in a payment period before receiving a disbursement of Pell Grant, FSEOG, TEACH Grant, or Direct Loan funds for the next payment period. The scheduled payment periods are established at the beginning of the program and do not change based on a student's rate of progression. If a student accelerates and completes additional hours or weeks, it does not affect the scheduled payment periods for Pell Grant and TEACH Grant amounts, but may result in proration of Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year if fewer hours remain. If a school cannot determine when a student has completed half of the required hours or weeks, the student is considered to have begun the second payment period at the later of completing half the coursework or half the weeks of instructional time.

In subscription-based programs, for the first two subscription periods, there is no requirement for completion of a certain amount of coursework before receiving a disbursement of Title IV funds. For each subsequent subscription period, however, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total hours enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods, excluding the most recently attended period. Additionally, schools may choose to make multiple disbursements within a payment period, but if so, the disbursements must be substantially equal, and for a single payment period loan, at least two installments are required unless an exception applies.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer

Effect of Accelerated Progression on Disbursement Timing in a Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Program The Pell Grant or TEACH Grant amount that a student is eligible to receive for a payment period in a clock-hour or non- term credit-hour program is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods for the program that are established at the beginning of the program based on the program length (as described earlier in this chapter).

This means that if a student completes additional weeks of instructional time or hours while completing the other measure of a payment period, the actual number of weeks or hours that the student completes before a disbursement can be made for the next payment period may differ from the number of weeks or hours in the scheduled payment period used to determine the student9s grant amount for the payment period. Although a student9s completion of additional weeks or hours in a payment period has no effect on the scheduled payment periods for purposes of determining Pell Grant and TEACH Grant payment amounts, an undergraduate student who accelerates in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year of a program. Specifically, if a student enrolled in a program that is greater than one academic year in length completes additional clock or credit hours prior to the final academic year of the program, this may result in a final period of study that contains fewer clock or credit hours than the number of hours in the program9s defined academic year. In this circumstance, the Direct Loan annual loan limit for an undergraduate student must be prorated (reduced). The principles described above are illustrated by the examples in Appendix A at the end of this chapter.

For information on Direct Loan annual loan limit proration and annual loan limit progression in clock-hour and non-term credit- hour programs, see Volume 8, Chapters 5 and 6.

However, to receive a disbursement of Title IV aid for each subsequent subscription period in the program, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods in the program, excluding the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in the most recently attended subscription period. For more detailed guidance on the disbursement rules for subscription-based programs, including examples, refer to Appendix B at the end of this chapter. Multiple Disbursements Within a Payment Period The regulations governing the Title IV programs generally permit schools to pay Title IV funds at such times and in such installments within each payment period as will best meet students9 needs. This gives schools the ability to apportion the payment if doing so will be in the best interest of the student. For example, if a payment period is particularly long, a school might choose to pay in multiple installments to the extent program requirements permit to ensure that a student will have funds to pay rent later in the payment period. If a school chooses to schedule multiple Direct Loan disbursements within a single payment period, the disbursements must be substantially equal. Note also that if the loan period for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless the school qualifies for an exception to the multiple disbursement requirement. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more']","The disbursement timing requirements for federal student aid differ significantly between clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs and subscription-based programs:

1. Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Programs:
- Disbursements are scheduled based on the successful completion of specific coursework, credit hours, and instructional weeks within each payment period.
- For programs of one academic year or less:
  - The first disbursement occurs after completing half of the credit hours and instructional weeks.
  - The second disbursement is for the remainder of the program.
- For programs longer than one academic year:
  - The first payment period is based on the first year's schedule.
  - Subsequent disbursements follow similar rules for each academic year.
- Importantly, students do **not** need to complete coursework or hours before receiving subsequent disbursements; disbursements are tied to scheduled completion, not actual progress.
- Accelerated progression (completing more hours or weeks early) may reduce eligibility for certain loans in the final year.

2. Subscription-Based Programs:
- For the first two subscription periods (terms), there is no requirement for coursework completion before disbursement.
- For subsequent periods, students must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total hours enrolled in all previous periods (excluding the most recent) to be eligible for disbursement.

Regarding flexibility in scheduling multiple disbursements within a payment period:
- Schools can schedule multiple disbursements to meet students' needs, especially for long payment periods.
- Disbursements must be **substantially equal** unless specific exceptions apply.
- For Direct Loans with a single payment period, at least two disbursements are generally required unless an exception (such as low default rate or elapsed time) applies.
- Schools have discretion to disburse funds in a single installment if certain conditions are met, such as a low cohort default rate or if more than half of the period has elapsed.

This flexibility allows schools to tailor disbursement schedules to best support students' financial needs while adhering to federal regulations.","In clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs, students must complete both the required credit or clock hours and the weeks of instructional time in a payment period before they can receive a disbursement of Pell Grant, FSEOG, TEACH Grant, or Direct Loan funds for the next payment period. The scheduled payment periods are established at the beginning of the program and do not change based on a student's rate of progression. If a student accelerates and completes additional weeks or hours, this does not affect the scheduled payment periods for determining grant amounts, but may result in reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year if the last period contains fewer hours than a defined academic year, requiring proration of the annual loan limit. In contrast, for subscription-based programs, there is no requirement for students to complete a certain amount of coursework before receiving disbursements for the first two subscription periods. For subsequent periods, students must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total hours enrolled in all previous subscription periods, excluding the most recent one. Additionally, schools have flexibility to schedule multiple disbursements within a payment period to best meet students' needs, such as splitting payments in longer periods, provided that Direct Loan disbursements within a single payment period are substantially equal and, if the loan period is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless an exception applies.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer

This may be due to constraints imposed by outside licensing bodies or the need to accommodate schedules of entities with which students are being placed (e.g., school districts or hospitals); and Credit hours associated with the practicum or clinical experience must be associated with the term in which most of the training occurs, even if the starting and ending dates do not exactly align with the term dates and/or overlap with another term. If the clinical work meets all the above criteria, terms which include such clinical work are not required to be considered nonstandard, nor are such programs required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. This flexibility is limited to required clinical periods associated with standard term programs in medicine (including, but not limited to, allopathic, osteopathic, nursing, veterinary, dentistry, pharmacy, and physical therapy), and student teaching required to obtain a state teaching certificate. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for additional guidance on certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets the criteria described above is included in a standard term. Nonstandard Terms Generally, nonstandard terms are terms that are not semesters, trimesters, or quarters. For example, a 5-week term or a 23-week term would be considered a nonstandard term because no standard term can be fewer than nine weeks or greater than 21 weeks in length. Like standard terms, nonstandard terms may be equal in length or may be of different lengths. If a program is offered in a combination of standard terms and nonstandard terms, the program is considered to be offered in nonstandard terms. Also, like standard terms, nonstandard terms may not overlap within a program. Even if a school calls its terms semesters, trimesters, or quarters, they are considered to be nonstandard terms if they do not comply with the policy on standard term length, as described earlier. For instance, a 22-week semester or an 8-week quarter must be treated as a nonstandard term, because a semester cannot contain more than 21 weeks and a quarter must include a minimum of nine weeks. Semesters, trimesters, or quarters are also considered to be nonstandard terms if academic progress is not measured in the manner normally associated with the type of term. For example, if a program is offered in 15-week semesters but measures academic progress in quarter credit hours, the semesters would be considered nonstandard terms.', '<2-hop>\n\nNon-Term Characteristics A program that measures progress in clock hours is always treated as a non-term program. Except for subscription-based programs, a program that measures progress in credit-hours is considered to have a non- term calendar if it has: Courses that do not begin and end within a set period of time such as a term; Courses that overlap terms; Self-paced and independent study courses that overlap terms; or Sequential courses that do not begin and end within a term. Payment Periods The payment period is applicable to all Title IV programs except the Federal Work-Study (FWS) Program. For example, Title IV program disbursements (except FWS payments) must be made on a payment period basis, as discussed in detail']","Clinical or practicum experiences required for licensure in medical or education programs can be included in a standard term if the following conditions are met:

1. All students in the program must participate in the practicum or clinical experience, and it must be a required condition for applying for licensure or authorization to practice the occupation.
2. The school has little or no control over the length or start and end dates of the practicum or clinical experience, often due to external licensing bodies or scheduling constraints with placement entities such as hospitals or school districts.
3. Credit hours associated with the practicum or clinical experience must be linked to the term during which most of the training occurs, even if the actual start and end dates overlap with another term or do not align exactly with the term dates.

This flexibility allows clinical work to be included in a standard term without the program being classified as nonstandard or non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps with another term.

Differences from non-term programs include:

- Non-term programs are characterized by measuring progress in clock hours rather than standard academic units.
- They often have courses that do not begin and end within a set period, overlap multiple terms, or are self-paced or independent study courses that do not fit within standard term boundaries.
- Non-term programs do not conform to the typical length and structure of standard academic terms (semesters, trimesters, or quarters).
- They are typically measured in clock hours and may include courses that do not follow the standard start and end dates or overlap with other terms.

In summary, clinical or practicum experiences can be included in a standard term if they are required for licensure, all students participate, the school has limited control over scheduling, and credit hours are associated with the term during which most of the training occurs. This inclusion is subject to specific conditions that distinguish it from non-term programs, which are more flexible and often measured in clock hours or have courses that do not fit within standard term structures.","A practicum or clinical experience required for licensure in a medical or education program can be included in a standard term if all students must participate in it as a condition for licensure, the school has little or no control over its length or dates (often due to external licensing bodies or placement schedules), and the credit hours are associated with the term in which most training occurs, even if the dates do not align exactly with the term or overlap another term. If these criteria are met, the program is not required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. In contrast, non-term programs are defined by characteristics such as measuring progress in clock hours, having courses that do not begin and end within a set term, courses that overlap terms, or self-paced and independent study courses. Thus, while required clinical experiences can be included in standard terms under specific conditions, programs with the non-term characteristics described must be treated as non-term programs.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer

This means that if a student completes additional weeks of instructional time or hours while completing the other measure of a payment period, the actual number of weeks or hours that the student completes before a disbursement can be made for the next payment period may differ from the number of weeks or hours in the scheduled payment period used to determine the student9s grant amount for the payment period. Although a student9s completion of additional weeks or hours in a payment period has no effect on the scheduled payment periods for purposes of determining Pell Grant and TEACH Grant payment amounts, an undergraduate student who accelerates in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year of a program. Specifically, if a student enrolled in a program that is greater than one academic year in length completes additional clock or credit hours prior to the final academic year of the program, this may result in a final period of study that contains fewer clock or credit hours than the number of hours in the program9s defined academic year. In this circumstance, the Direct Loan annual loan limit for an undergraduate student must be prorated (reduced). The principles described above are illustrated by the examples in Appendix A at the end of this chapter. For guidance on calculating Pell Grant and TEACH Grant awards for clock-hour and non-term credit-hour programs, see Volume 7. For information on Direct Loan annual loan limit proration and annual loan limit progression in clock-hour and non-term credit- hour programs, see Volume 8, Chapters 5 and 6. If your school is unable to determine when a student has successfully completed half of the credit or clock hours in a program, academic year, or remainder of a program, the student is considered to have begun the second payment period of the program, academic year, or remainder of a program at the later of the date (identified by your school) that the student has successfully completed: half of the academic coursework in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program; or half of the number of weeks of instructional time in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program.', '<2-hop>\n\nDisbursement Timing in Subscription-Based Programs For the first two subscription periods (terms) that a student attends in a subscription-based program, there is no requirement for the student to have completed a certain amount of coursework before receiving a disbursement of Title IV funds (the same as in any other term-based program using credit hours). However, to receive a disbursement of Title IV aid for each subsequent subscription period in the program, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods in the program, excluding the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in the most recently attended subscription period. For more detailed guidance on the disbursement rules for subscription-based programs, including examples, refer to Appendix B at the end of this chapter. Multiple Disbursements Within a Payment Period The regulations governing the Title IV programs generally permit schools to pay Title IV funds at such times and in such installments within each payment period as will best meet students9 needs. This gives schools the ability to apportion the payment if doing so will be in the best interest of the student. For example, if a payment period is particularly long, a school might choose to pay in multiple installments to the extent program requirements permit to ensure that a student will have funds to pay rent later in the payment period. If a school chooses to schedule multiple Direct Loan disbursements within a single payment period, the disbursements must be substantially equal. Note also that if the loan period for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless the school qualifies for an exception to the multiple disbursement requirement. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more']","The disbursement timing requirements for federal student aid differ between clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs and subscription-based programs in several ways:

1. Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Programs:
- Disbursements are scheduled based on the successful completion of scheduled payment periods, which are determined by clock hours and instructional weeks.
- Students are considered to have begun the second payment period when they have completed either half of the coursework (hours) or half of the instructional weeks, whichever is later.
- Disbursements are tied to scheduled milestones, not actual coursework completion, meaning students do not need to complete coursework or credit hours before receiving subsequent disbursements.
- Accelerated progression (completing additional hours or weeks) does not change the scheduled disbursement dates but may affect eligibility for certain loans, such as prorating the Direct Loan limit if fewer hours are completed in the final year.

2. Subscription-Based Programs:
- For the first two subscription periods (terms), there is no requirement for students to have completed a certain amount of coursework before receiving disbursements.
- For subsequent subscription periods, students must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total hours enrolled in all previous periods (excluding the most recent) before receiving further disbursements.

Regarding flexibility in scheduling multiple disbursements within a payment period:
- Schools have the flexibility to disburse Title IV funds in multiple installments within a payment period if it best meets students' needs.
- If multiple disbursements are scheduled within the same payment period, they must be substantially equal.
- For Direct Loans with a loan period that is a single payment period, the second disbursement generally cannot be made until the student has completed half of the instructional weeks and hours, unless exceptions apply.
- Schools can also make multiple disbursements in longer payment periods to ensure students have funds when needed, such as for rent or other expenses.

In summary, clock-hour and non-term programs focus on scheduled milestones for disbursements without requiring coursework completion, while subscription-based programs require cumulative coursework completion for subsequent disbursements. Schools have significant flexibility to schedule multiple disbursements, provided they adhere to the requirement that disbursements within a payment period are substantially equal when multiple are made.","In clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs, students must complete both the required credit or clock hours and the weeks of instructional time in a payment period before they can receive a disbursement of Pell Grant, FSEOG, TEACH Grant, or Direct Loan funds for the next payment period. The scheduled payment periods are established at the beginning of the program and do not change based on a student's rate of progression. If a student accelerates and completes additional weeks or hours, this does not affect the scheduled payment periods for Pell Grant and TEACH Grant amounts, but may result in reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year if the last period contains fewer hours than the defined academic year, requiring proration of the loan limit.

In subscription-based programs, for the first two subscription periods, there is no requirement for the student to complete a certain amount of coursework before receiving a disbursement of Title IV funds. However, for each subsequent subscription period, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total number of hours for which they were enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods, excluding the most recently attended period.

Additionally, schools have flexibility in scheduling multiple disbursements within a payment period for Title IV programs. They may pay funds in such times and installments as best meet students’ needs, such as splitting payments in longer periods to help students manage expenses. If multiple Direct Loan disbursements are scheduled within a single payment period, they must be substantially equal, and if the loan period is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless an exception applies.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer

This may be due to constraints imposed by outside licensing bodies or the need to accommodate schedules of entities with which students are being placed (e.g., school districts or hospitals); and Credit hours associated with the practicum or clinical experience must be associated with the term in which most of the training occurs, even if the starting and ending dates do not exactly align with the term dates and/or overlap with another term. If the clinical work meets all the above criteria, terms which include such clinical work are not required to be considered nonstandard, nor are such programs required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. This flexibility is limited to required clinical periods associated with standard term programs in medicine (including, but not limited to, allopathic, osteopathic, nursing, veterinary, dentistry, pharmacy, and physical therapy), and student teaching required to obtain a state teaching certificate. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for additional guidance on certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets the criteria described above is included in a standard term. Nonstandard Terms Generally, nonstandard terms are terms that are not semesters, trimesters, or quarters. For example, a 5-week term or a 23-week term would be considered a nonstandard term because no standard term can be fewer than nine weeks or greater than 21 weeks in length. Like standard terms, nonstandard terms may be equal in length or may be of different lengths. If a program is offered in a combination of standard terms and nonstandard terms, the program is considered to be offered in nonstandard terms. Also, like standard terms, nonstandard terms may not overlap within a program. Even if a school calls its terms semesters, trimesters, or quarters, they are considered to be nonstandard terms if they do not comply with the policy on standard term length, as described earlier. For instance, a 22-week semester or an 8-week quarter must be treated as a nonstandard term, because a semester cannot contain more than 21 weeks and a quarter must include a minimum of nine weeks. Semesters, trimesters, or quarters are also considered to be nonstandard terms if academic progress is not measured in the manner normally associated with the type of term. For example, if a program is offered in 15-week semesters but measures academic progress in quarter credit hours, the semesters would be considered nonstandard terms.', '<2-hop>\n\nDisbursement Timing in Subscription-Based Programs For the first two subscription periods (terms) that a student attends in a subscription-based program, there is no requirement for the student to have completed a certain amount of coursework before receiving a disbursement of Title IV funds (the same as in any other term-based program using credit hours).

If the clinical work is conducted outside the classroom but satisfies all the required conditions—such as participation by all students, lack of control over the clinical schedule, and credit hours associated with the term during which most of the training occurs—it can be included in a standard term without classifying the program as nonstandard. This inclusion provides flexibility, enabling the clinical work to be associated with the actual period during which it occurs, even if it begins before or ends after the standard term dates.

Regarding disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when such clinical work is included, the rules are adjusted as follows:
- If clinical work begins before the start of the associated term, the loan period start date is set to the beginning date of the clinical work.
- If the clinical work ends after the end of the associated term, the loan period end date is adjusted to the clinical work’s ending date.
- These adjustments may also require modifications to the academic year period and payment periods to ensure disbursements align with the actual clinical work schedule rather than the standard term dates.
- Overlapping loan periods are permissible if clinical work associated with subsequent periods has not yet been completed.

This flexibility ensures that disbursements are properly aligned with the clinical work schedule, providing a more accurate reflection of the training period.","Volume 8, Chapter 3 explains that clinical work in standard term programs may be included in a standard term if all students are required to participate as a condition for licensure, the school has little or no control over the practicum’s timing, and credit hours are associated with the term in which most training occurs. If these criteria are met, the terms do not have to be considered nonstandard, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. For Direct Loans, Volume 8, Chapter 3 provides additional guidance on exceptions to normal loan period and disbursement timing rules when such clinical work is included in a standard term.

In a standard term or nonstandard term academic calendar, a term is generally a period in which all classes are scheduled to begin and end within a set time frame, and academic progress is measured in credit hours. In a non-term academic calendar, classes do not begin and end within a set time frame, such as a term. Academic progress in a non-term program can be measured in either credit or clock hours. In some cases (as discussed below), a program with terms must be treated as a non-term program for Title IV purposes. A subscription-based academic calendar is used only by subscription-based programs. A subscription-based program is a term-based program in which the school charges a student for each term on a subscription basis with the expectation that the student will complete a specified number of credit hours (or the equivalent) during that term. However, classes in a subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term, as is the case in a term-based calendar that is not subscription-based. For more detail on subscription-based programs, see Volume 2, Chapter 2. A subscription-based academic calendar consists of ""subscription periods"" that are either standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms (for guidance on when terms are considered to be substantially equal in length, see <Payment periods for programs using standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms= later in this chapter). Substantially equal nonstandard terms may be of any length, but if they are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for purposes of monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6 for more information on BBAY 3). Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length are not permissible in a subscription-based academic calendar. The term ""subscription period"" is synonymous with ""term"" and ""payment period"" (payment periods are covered later in this chapter). Except for the fact that classes are not required to start and end within a term, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs. These requirements include: minimum and maximum term length restrictions for standard terms (see the discussion in the next section of this chapter); requirements for determining full-time enrollment (see Volume 1, Chapter 1); use of a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY), BBAY 1, BBAY 2, or BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6); and use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards (see Volume 7, Chapter 4). Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. Standard Terms: Semesters, Trimesters, and Quarters Semesters and trimesters contain between 14 and 21 weeks of instructional time. However, a summer term in a program using semesters or trimesters may contain fewer than 14 weeks. An academic calendar that uses semesters or trimesters traditionally has three terms, one each in the fall, spring, and summer, two of which comprise an academic year. For example, in a program using an SAY calendar, fall and spring would comprise an academic year. In a program using a']","The structure of non-term and subscription-based academic calendars significantly influences the calculation and disbursement of Pell Grant awards in clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs. 

For non-term programs, the Pell award is always based on the full-time Scheduled Award, regardless of whether the student is attending full or part time, unless the student is enrolled less than half time. In such cases, the Cost of Attendance (COA) must be adjusted. The disbursement schedule is determined by payment periods, which are established based on the program's length and schedule, and Pell funds are paid in installments over these periods. The scheduled payment periods do not change even if a student accelerates or completes additional hours or weeks earlier than scheduled, although acceleration may impact other aid eligibility such as Direct Loans.

Subscription-based programs differ in that disbursements for initial subscription periods do not require the student to have completed coursework, but subsequent disbursements depend on the student having completed a cumulative number of credit hours from previous subscription periods. This structure affects disbursement timing, as aid is contingent upon coursework completion in prior periods.

The non-term and subscription-based calendars often do not align with traditional academic calendars, which can affect the timing of disbursements and the calculation of awards. For example, in non-term programs, the award is based on scheduled payment periods derived from the program's length, not necessarily the actual weeks or hours completed at any given time. Similarly, in subscription-based programs, disbursements are linked to coursework completion across subscription periods, influencing when funds are released.

Overall, these calendar structures require schools to carefully determine payment periods and disbursement schedules based on the program's design, ensuring that Pell Grant awards are accurately calculated and disbursed in accordance with the established schedule, regardless of acceleration or variations in student progress.","The structure of non-term and subscription-based academic calendars directly impacts the calculation and disbursement of Pell Grant awards in clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs. In non-term academic calendars, classes do not begin and end within a set timeframe, and academic progress can be measured in either credit or clock hours. For Pell Grant awards in these programs, the amount a student is eligible to receive for a payment period is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods established at the beginning of the program. These scheduled payment periods do not change, regardless of a student’s rate of progression. In subscription-based programs, which are a type of term-based program, Pell Grant awards are calculated using Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3, and the term 'subscription period' is synonymous with 'term' and 'payment period.' The rules for term-based programs also apply to subscription-based programs, including requirements for determining full-time enrollment and the use of specific academic year structures. Therefore, the academic calendar type determines both the method for calculating Pell Grant awards and the timing of disbursements under Title IV regulations.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

Subscription-Based Programs For the first two subscription periods (terms) that a student attends in a subscription-based program, there is no requirement for the student to have completed a certain amount of coursework before receiving a disbursement of Title IV funds (the same as in any other term-based program using credit hours). However, to receive a disbursement of Title IV aid for each subsequent subscription period in the program, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods in the program, excluding the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in the most recently attended subscription period. For more detailed guidance on the disbursement rules for subscription-based programs, including examples, refer to Appendix B at the end of this chapter. Multiple Disbursements Within a Payment Period The regulations governing the Title IV programs generally permit schools to pay Title IV funds at such times and in such installments within each payment period as will best meet students9 needs. This gives schools the ability to apportion the payment if doing so will be in the best interest of the student. For example, if a payment period is particularly long, a school might choose to pay in multiple installments to the extent program requirements permit to ensure that a student will have funds to pay rent later in the payment period. If a school chooses to schedule multiple Direct Loan disbursements within a single payment period, the disbursements must be substantially equal. Note also that if the loan period for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless the school qualifies for an exception to the multiple disbursement requirement. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more', '<2-hop>\n\nnon-term (includes clock-hour calendars), or subscription-based. In a standard term or nonstandard term academic calendar, a term is generally a period in which all classes are scheduled to begin and end within a set time frame, and academic progress is measured in credit hours. In a non-term academic calendar, classes do not begin and end within a set time frame, such as a term. Academic progress in a non-term program can be measured in either credit or clock hours. In some cases (as discussed below), a program with terms must be treated as a non-term program for Title IV purposes. A subscription-based academic calendar is used only by subscription-based programs. A subscription-based program is a term-based program in which the school charges a student for each term on a subscription basis with the expectation that the student will complete a specified number of credit hours (or the equivalent) during that term. However, classes in a subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term, as is the case in a term-based calendar that is not subscription-based. For more detail on subscription-based programs, see Volume 2, Chapter 2. A subscription-based academic calendar consists of ""subscription periods"" that are either standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms (for guidance on when terms are considered to be substantially equal in length, see <Payment periods for programs using standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms= later in this chapter). Substantially equal nonstandard terms may be of any length, but if they are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for purposes of monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6 for more information on BBAY 3). Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length are not permissible in a subscription-based academic calendar. The term ""subscription period"" is synonymous with ""term"" and ""payment period"" (payment periods are covered later in this chapter). Except for the fact that classes are not required to start and end within a term, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs. These requirements include: minimum and maximum term length restrictions for standard terms (see the discussion in the next section of this chapter); requirements for determining full-time enrollment (see Volume 1, Chapter 1); use of a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY), BBAY 1, BBAY 2, or BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6); and use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards (see Volume 7, Chapter 4). Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. Standard Terms: Semesters, Trimesters, and Quarters Semesters and trimesters contain between 14 and 21 weeks of instructional time. However, a summer term in a program using semesters or trimesters may contain fewer than 14 weeks. An academic calendar that uses semesters or trimesters traditionally has three terms, one each in the fall, spring, and summer, two of which comprise an academic year. For example, in a program using an SAY calendar, fall and spring would comprise an academic year. In a program using a']","The requirements for disbursement timing and academic progress differ between subscription-based programs and standard term or non-term academic calendars in several ways:

1. Disbursement Timing:
   - Standard Term/Non-Term Calendars: Disbursements are generally tied to the completion of scheduled terms, credit hours, or weeks of instructional time. Disbursements are made based on students completing these scheduled periods, often at the end of each term.
   - Subscription-Based Programs: For the first two subscription periods (terms), there is no coursework completion requirement for disbursement. Starting from the third subscription period, students must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total of all previously attended subscription periods (excluding the most recent). Disbursements are delayed until the student has completed the necessary cumulative hours, which depend on the student's enrollment status (full-time or half-time). Early disbursement (up to 10 days before the start of a subscription period) is permitted only if the student has already met the coursework requirement for that period.

2. Use of Subscription Periods:
   - Standard Calendars: Use fixed scheduled terms with specific start and end dates.
   - Subscription-Based Programs: Use ""subscription periods"" that may be standard or substantially equal nonstandard terms, but classes are not required to begin or end within specific timeframes. These periods are flexible, and disbursement requirements are based on cumulative progress rather than fixed schedules.

3. Academic Progress:
   - Standard Calendars: Progress is measured within each scheduled term, and disbursements are linked to term completion.
   - Subscription-Based Programs: For the first two subscription periods, disbursements are not contingent on coursework completion. From the third period onward, students must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours (based on all previous periods) to qualify for disbursement. If a student does not begin attendance in new coursework during a subscription period, they are ineligible for funds for that period.

4. BBAY 3 and Multiple Disbursements:
   - BBAY 3 is used for monitoring Direct Loan progress, especially when terms are not substantially equal or are shorter than nine weeks.
   - Multiple disbursements within a payment period are permitted, but if scheduled, they must be substantially equal. The flexibility in disbursement timing and the use of BBAY 3 are specific considerations in subscription-based programs.

In summary, subscription-based programs offer more initial flexibility in disbursement timing, with progress-dependent disbursements starting from the third subscription period, and they utilize cumulative credit hour requirements and BBAY monitoring to ensure proper disbursement and progress tracking.","In subscription-based programs, as described in Volume 8, Chapter 6 and referenced in Volume 8, Chapter 3, the disbursement timing for Title IV aid differs from standard term or non-term academic calendars. For the first two subscription periods, students are not required to complete a certain amount of coursework before receiving Title IV funds, similar to other term-based programs using credit hours. However, for subsequent subscription periods, students must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods, excluding the most recent one, to receive further disbursements. Subscription-based programs use 'subscription periods,' which are synonymous with 'terms' or 'payment periods,' and these can be standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms. If nonstandard terms are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression. Additionally, schools may choose to make multiple disbursements within a payment period, but if they do so for Direct Loans, the disbursements must be substantially equal, and if the loan period is a single payment period, at least two installments are required unless an exception applies. These requirements ensure that aid is awarded and disbursed in accordance with the unique structure of subscription-based programs, as opposed to the more rigid timing and progress requirements in standard term or non-term calendars.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
