"how title iv work with all these different calendars like standard term, nonterm, and subscription-based, and what stuff we gotta do different for each one?","['non-term (includes clock-hour calendars), or\\nsubscription-based.\\nIn a standard term or nonstandard term academic calendar, a term is generally a period in which all classes are\\nscheduled to begin and end within a set time frame, and academic progress is measured in credit hours.\\nIn a non-term academic calendar, classes do not begin and end within a set time frame, such as a term. Academic\\nprogress in a non-term program can be measured in either credit or clock hours. In some cases (as discussed below), a\\nprogram with terms must be treated as a non-term program for Title IV purposes.\\nA subscription-based academic calendar is used only by subscription-based programs. A subscription-based program\\nis a term-based program in which the school charges a student for each term on a subscription basis with the expectation\\nthat the student will complete a specified number of credit hours (or the equivalent) during that term. However, classes in\\na subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term, as is the case in a\\nterm-based calendar that is not subscription-based. For more detail on subscription-based programs, see Volume 2,\\nChapter 2.\\nA subscription-based academic calendar consists of ""subscription periods"" that are either standard terms or substantially\\nequal nonstandard terms (for guidance on when terms are considered to be substantially equal in length, see <Payment\\nperiods for programs using standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms= later in this chapter). Substantially\\nequal nonstandard terms may be of any length, but if they are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use\\nBBAY 3 for purposes of monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6 for more\\ninformation on BBAY 3). Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length are not permissible in a\\nsubscription-based academic calendar.\\nThe term ""subscription period"" is synonymous with ""term"" and ""payment period"" (payment periods are covered later in\\nthis chapter). Except for the fact that classes are not required to start and end within a term, the rules and requirements\\nfor term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs. These requirements\\ninclude:\\nminimum and maximum term length restrictions for standard terms (see the discussion in the next section of this\\nchapter);\\nrequirements for determining full-time enrollment (see Volume 1, Chapter 1);\\nuse of a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY), BBAY 1, BBAY 2, or BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit\\nprogression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6); and\\nuse of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards (see Volume 7, Chapter 4).\\nWhether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for\\nhow aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs.\\nStandard Terms: Semesters, Trimesters, and Quarters\\nSemesters and trimesters contain between 14 and 21 weeks of instructional time. However, a summer term in a program\\nusing semesters or trimesters may contain fewer than 14 weeks. An academic calendar that uses semesters or trimesters\\ntraditionally has three terms, one each in the fall, spring, and summer, two of which comprise an academic year.

In some instances, the defined academic year for a\\nprogram may not coincide with the academic calendar of the school. For example, a school might define the academic\\nyear for a program as containing 24 semester hours and 30 weeks of instructional time but have an academic calendar\\nconsisting of four 8-week nonstandard terms (i.e., 32 weeks of instructional time).

For example, a week consisting only of\\nvacation days is not a week of instructional time.']","['non-term (includes clock-hour calendars), or subscription-based. In a standard term or nonstandard term academic calendar, a term is generally a period in which all classes are scheduled to begin and end within a set time frame, and academic progress is measured in credit hours. In a non-term academic calendar, classes do not begin and end within a set time frame, such as a term. Academic progress in a non-term program can be measured in either credit or clock hours. In some cases (as discussed below), a program with terms must be treated as a non-term program for Title IV purposes. A subscription-based academic calendar is used only by subscription-based programs. A subscription-based program is a term-based program in which the school charges a student for each term on a subscription basis with the expectation that the student will complete a specified number of credit hours (or the equivalent) during that term. However, classes in a subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term, as is the case in a term-based calendar that is not subscription-based. For more detail on subscription-based programs, see Volume 2, Chapter 2. A subscription-based academic calendar consists of ""subscription periods"" that are either standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms (for guidance on when terms are considered to be substantially equal in length, see <Payment periods for programs using standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms= later in this chapter). Substantially equal nonstandard terms may be of any length, but if they are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for purposes of monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6 for more information on BBAY 3). Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length are not permissible in a subscription-based academic calendar. The term ""subscription period"" is synonymous with ""term"" and ""payment period"" (payment periods are covered later in this chapter). Except for the fact that classes are not required to start and end within a term, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs. These requirements include: minimum and maximum term length restrictions for standard terms (see the discussion in the next section of this chapter); requirements for determining full-time enrollment (see Volume 1, Chapter 1); use of a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY), BBAY 1, BBAY 2, or BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6); and use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards (see Volume 7, Chapter 4). Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. Standard Terms: Semesters, Trimesters, and Quarters Semesters and trimesters contain between 14 and 21 weeks of instructional time. However, a summer term in a program using semesters or trimesters may contain fewer than 14 weeks. An academic calendar that uses semesters or trimesters traditionally has three terms, one each in the fall, spring, and summer, two of which comprise an academic year. For example, in a program using an SAY calendar, fall and spring would comprise an academic year. In a program using a']","Title IV federal student aid interacts with different academic calendars—standard term, nonterm, and subscription-based—in specific ways, with distinct procedures and requirements for each:

1. **Standard Term and Nonstandard Term Academic Calendars:**
   - These calendars are characterized by fixed periods in which all classes begin and end within a set timeframe.
   - Academic progress is typically measured in credit hours.
   - The same rules and requirements for Title IV aid, including disbursement and monitoring, apply to both standard and nonstandard term programs.
   - When calculating Pell Grant awards, the program’s academic calendar generally determines the Pell formula to be used, and this formula remains consistent throughout the program unless a change is made at the start of a new award year.
   - Pell Grants are disbursed over payment periods aligned with these terms, and students must enroll in the specific payment periods to receive disbursements.
   - The academic year for these programs must meet minimum credit or clock hour and week-of-instruction standards.

2. **Non-term (including clock-hour calendars):**
   - Classes do not have fixed start and end dates within a term.
   - Academic progress can be measured in credit or clock hours.
   - Schools have the option to treat a program as non-term for Title IV purposes, which affects how aid is awarded and disbursed.
   - The procedures for disbursement and monitoring are similar to those for term-based programs, but the lack of fixed terms means that the timing of disbursements may be more flexible.
   - The program’s defined academic year still needs to meet regulatory minimums for hours and instructional time.

3. **Subscription-based Academic Calendars:**
   - Used only by subscription-based programs, where students are charged per subscription period, which may be a standard or substantially equal nonstandard term.
   - Classes are not required to start or end within a specific timeframe each subscription period.
   - The subscription period is considered equivalent to a ""term"" and is subject to similar rules as standard or nonstandard terms, including minimum and maximum length restrictions.
   - The same procedures for awarding and disbursing aid apply as in term-based programs, including the use of the same formulas for Pell Grants and the requirement to disburse aid over payment periods.
   - Schools must ensure that subscription periods meet the criteria for substantial equality if nonstandard, and monitor hours and weeks of instruction accordingly.
   - The key difference is the flexibility in class scheduling within each subscription period, but the overall aid procedures and requirements remain consistent with other calendar types.

**In summary:**
- All calendar types require adherence to federal rules for disbursement, progress monitoring, and award calculation.
- Fixed-term calendars (standard and nonstandard) follow traditional semester or quarter schedules.
- Non-term calendars offer more flexibility but still require compliance with minimum hour and instructional time standards.
- Subscription-based calendars combine features of term-based schedules with flexible class start/end dates within subscription periods, but the same aid procedures and requirements apply as with other calendar types.","Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. For standard term or nonstandard term calendars, terms are periods where all classes start and end within a set timeframe, and progress is measured in credit hours. Non-term calendars don’t have set start and end times for classes, and progress can be measured in credit or clock hours. Sometimes, a program with terms must be treated as non-term for Title IV purposes. Subscription-based programs are term-based but charge students by subscription, and classes don’t have to start or end within a specific timeframe. The rules for term-based programs that aren’t subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs, including term length restrictions, full-time enrollment requirements, monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression, and Pell Grant formulas.

"According to Volume 8, Chapter 3, what are the specific exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets the outlined criteria is included in a standard term, and how does this guidance affect federal student aid administration for programs with required clinical or practicum experiences?","['Inclusion of Clinical Work in a Standard Term\\nPeriods of medical and education program clinical work which is conducted outside the classroom may not be included in\\na standard term, unless all of the following apply:\\nAll students in the program must participate in the practicum or clinical experience, and they must be required to\\ncomplete the practicum or clinical experience as a condition for applying for licensure or authorization to practice the\\noccupation they intend to pursue;\\nThe school has little or no control over the length or starting and ending dates of the practicum or clinical\\nexperience. This may be due to constraints imposed by outside licensing bodies or the need to accommodate\\nschedules of entities with which students are being placed (e.g., school districts or hospitals); and\\nCredit hours associated with the practicum or clinical experience must be associated with the term in which most of\\nthe training occurs, even if the starting and ending dates do not exactly align with the term dates and/or overlap with\\nanother term.\\nIf the clinical work meets all the above criteria, terms which include such clinical work are not required to be considered\\nnonstandard, nor are such programs required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term.\\nThis flexibility is limited to required clinical periods associated with standard term programs in medicine (including, but\\nnot limited to, allopathic, osteopathic, nursing, veterinary, dentistry, pharmacy, and physical therapy), and student\\nteaching required to obtain a state teaching certificate.\\nSee Volume 8, Chapter 3 for additional guidance on certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing\\nrules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets the criteria described above is included in a standard term.\\nNonstandard Terms\\nGenerally, nonstandard terms are terms that are not semesters, trimesters, or quarters. For example, a 5-week term or a\\n23-week term would be considered a nonstandard term because no standard term can be fewer than nine weeks or\\ngreater than 21 weeks in length. Like standard terms, nonstandard terms may be equal in length or may be of different\\nlengths. If a program is offered in a combination of standard terms and nonstandard terms, the program is considered to\\nbe offered in nonstandard terms. Also, like standard terms, nonstandard terms may not overlap within a program.\\nEven if a school calls its terms semesters, trimesters, or quarters, they are considered to be nonstandard terms if they do\\nnot comply with the policy on standard term length, as described earlier. For instance, a 22-week semester or an 8-week\\nquarter must be treated as a nonstandard term, because a semester cannot contain more than 21 weeks and a quarter\\nmust include a minimum of nine weeks.\\nSemesters, trimesters, or quarters are also considered to be nonstandard terms if academic progress is not measured in\\nthe manner normally associated with the type of term. For example, if a program is offered in 15-week semesters but\\nmeasures academic progress in quarter credit hours, the semesters would be considered nonstandard terms.\\nNon-Term Characteristics\\nA program that measures progress in clock hours is always treated as a non-term program.\\nExcept for subscription-based programs, a program that measures progress in credit-hours is considered to have a non-\\nterm calendar if it has:\\nCourses that do not begin and end within a set period of time such as a term;\\nCourses that overlap terms;\\nSelf-paced and independent study courses that overlap terms; or\\nSequential courses that do not begin and end within a term.\\nPayment Periods\\nThe payment period is applicable to all Title IV programs except the Federal Work-Study (FWS) Program. For example,\\nTitle IV program disbursements (except FWS payments) must be made on a payment period basis, as discussed in detail', 'may not notify the school or the loan servicer right away, particularly if the parent borrower had requested a deferment of\\npayments while the student was enrolled at least half time.\\nIf a school is required to return Direct PLUS Loan funds that were disbursed after the date of the parent borrower9s death,\\nthe school should determine whether there is a surviving parent who can take out a Direct PLUS Loan for the amount of\\nthe original Direct PLUS loan that must be returned. If this is not an option, the school may award additional Direct\\nUnsubsidized Loan funds (up to the amounts normally available only to independent undergraduates) to the dependent\\nstudent (see <Annual Loan Limits for Independent Undergraduates and Certain Dependent Undergraduates= in Chapter 4\\nof this volume). In this specific circumstance, a school may originate a Direct PLUS Loan for a surviving parent or originate\\na Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the dependent student even if the loan period has ended.\\nFor additional guidance on other actions that a school must take when a Title IV aid recipient dies, see Appendix B of the\\nFSA Handbook.\\nExceptions to the Normal Loan Period and Disbursement Requirements When Clinical Work is Included in a Standard Term\\nVolume 3, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook describes standard terms (semesters, quarters, and trimesters) and\\nnonstandard terms, and explains that standard terms or nonstandard terms that are substantially equal and at least nine\\nweeks in length (<SE9W= nonstandard terms) may not include periods of clinical work, such as medical and education\\nprogram work which is conducted outside the classroom, unless certain requirements are met (see <Inclusion of Clinical\\nWork in a Standard Term=). If a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term contains clinical work that meets all the criteria\\nto be included in the term, this may result in certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement rules as\\ndiscussed earlier in this chapter. We discuss these exceptions below.\\nIf clinical work meets the criteria described in Volume 3 to be included in a standard term or SE9W nonstandard\\nterm, the school must associate the clinical work with the term during which the majority of the clinical work occurs.\\nIf a student receives a Direct Loan for a term that includes clinical work and the clinical work begins before the\\nstarting date of the term with which the clinical work is associated, the loan period start date is the beginning date of\\nthe clinical work (rather than the starting date of the term, as would normally be the case).\\nFor example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring\\nsemesters that run from September 1 through May 31, and the fall semester includes clinical work that begins on\\nAugust 15, the school would report the loan period dates as August 15 through May 31. If the clinical work does not\\nbegin until on or after the starting date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period start date would be\\nthe beginning date of the term.\\nIf the clinical work ends after the ending date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period end date for a\\nDirect Loan is the ending date of the clinical work (instead of the ending date of the term, as would normally be the\\ncase).\\nFor example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring\\nsemesters that run from September 1 through December 31 (fall) and January 1 through May 31 (spring), and the\\nspring semester includes clinical work that ends on June 20, the school would report the loan period dates as\\nSeptember 1 through June 20. However, if the clinical work ends on or before the ending date of the term with which\\nit is associated, the loan period end date would be the ending date of the term.\\nIf loan period dates are adjusted as explained above to account for clinical work that begins before or ends after the\\nnormal term starting and ending dates, the academic year period to which the Direct Loan annual loan limit applies,\\nand the payment period dates must also be adjusted accordingly. Using the example above where the spring term of\\na fall-spring SAY contains clinical work that ends on June 20, and assuming that the annual loan limit applies to that\\nfall-spring SAY period, the school would report the academic year dates associated with the loan as September 1\\nthrough June 20, and would report the dates of the second payment period (the spring semester) as January 1\\nthrough June 20 (see Volume 3, Chapter 1 for guidance on payment periods, and Chapter 6 of this volume for\\ninformation on SAYs and monitoring annual loan limits).\\nIf there are two consecutive loan periods for standard terms or SE9W nonstandard terms that include clinical work,\\nand the first loan period has not ended when the clinical work associated with the next loan period is scheduled to\\nbegin (because the clinical work associated with the term has not yet been completed), it is permissible for the two\\nloan periods (and the associated payment periods) to overlap.', 'period are separated by one or more terms in which the student is ineligible. For example, if a student is expected to be\\nenrolled on at least a half-time basis in the fall and spring quarters of an academic year consisting of the fall, winter, and\\nspring quarters, but the student indicates that they do not plan to attend the winter quarter (or that they plan to be\\nenrolled on a less than half-time basis during that quarter), the school may still originate a loan for a loan period covering\\nthe fall, winter, and spring quarters. Of course, no costs associated with winter quarter may be included in the student9s\\nCOA when determining the loan amount the student is eligible to receive for the fall and spring quarters. Similarly, if a\\nschool initially originates a loan for a fall-winter-spring loan period based on a student9s anticipated enrollment status of\\nat least half time during all three quarters, but the student subsequently does not attend the winter quarter or temporarily\\ndrops below half-time status for that term, and then resumes at least half-time enrollment in the spring, the school is not\\nrequired to make any changes to the original fall-winter-spring loan period. However, it may be necessary for the school\\nto adjust the originally approved loan amount if that amount is no longer supported by the reduced costs for the fall and\\nspring quarters only.\\nIn the first scenario described above the school could also choose to originate two separate loans for fall-only and spring-\\nonly loan periods. In the second scenario the school would also have the option of adjusting the original fall-winter-spring\\nloan period to fall-only, and then originating a new spring-only loan. Note, however, that in both cases the school would\\nthen be required to separately subtract the student9s full SAI from the fall-only and spring-only costs when determining\\nthe student9s Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility for those terms (see <No Alternate SAI When Originating Loans for Periods\\nOther Than Nine Months= earlier in this chapter). In some cases this could significantly reduce or even eliminate a\\nstudent9s need for Direct Subsidized Loans. In contrast, using a fall-winter-spring loan period (excluding all costs\\nassociated with the winter quarter) would allow the school to subtract the full SAI from the higher combined costs for the\\nfall and spring terms, partially mitigating the effect of not having alternate SAIs for periods of enrollment other than nine\\nmonths.\\nThe limited exception described above applies only if a student is eligible to receive a Direct Loan during the first and last\\nterms within the loan period. The term in which the student is ineligible cannot be the first or last term in the loan period.\\nFor instance, a school may not originate a loan for a fall-winter-spring loan period if the student does not attend the fall\\nterm or the spring term.\\nNote: See the guidance at the end of this chapter for certain exceptions to the normal loan period rules that apply when\\nperiods of clinical work are included in a standard term.\\nMinimum Loan Periods\\nThe minimum period for which a school may originate a Direct Loan varies depending on the school9s academic calendar.\\nAs explained below and in Chapter 7, different rules apply for purposes of determining the minimum loan period for a\\nDirect Loan and the type of academic year that a school may use to monitor Direct Loan annual loan limits depending on\\nwhether a program is term-based (including subscription-based programs; see Volume 3, Chapter 1) with either standard\\nor nonstandard terms, or is a non-term program (all clock-hour programs are treated as non-term programs), and in the\\ncase of a term-based program with nonstandard terms, depending on the type of nonstandard term, as described below.\\nNonstandard terms may be one of the following types:\\n1. \\nNonstandard terms that are substantially equal (no term in the academic year differs in length from any\\nother term by more than two weeks), and each of the terms is at least nine weeks in length.\\nSE9W\\nPeriod of Enrollment (Loan Period) Definition\\n34 CFR 685.102(b)', 'hour, or non-SE9W nonstandard term program is offered in modules, the minimum loan period is still the lesser of the\\nacademic year or the program length (or remaining portion of the program).\\nFor Title IV aid purposes, students are allowed to skip one or more modules. However, if a loan period includes modules\\nthat the student does not attend, the COA for the loan period may not include costs associated with those modules.\\nMinimum Loan Period: Standard Term Combined With an Intersession\\nAs we explain under <Intersessions= in Volume 3, Chapter 1, in limited cases for academic programs offered in standard\\nterms, a short nonstandard term (often called an <intersession=) may be combined with a preceding or following standard\\nterm and considered to be a single standard term. In such cases, the minimum loan period for a Direct Loan is different\\ndepending on whether a student attends the intersession. If a student who attends the intersession requests a loan for the\\ncombined term, the loan period includes the standard term plus the intersession. However, if the student attends only the\\nstandard term and is not enrolled in the intersession that is attached to that term, the loan period includes only the\\nstandard term.\\nMaximum Loan Periods\\nThe maximum period for which you may originate a Direct Loan is generally an academic year. However, if your school\\napplies the annual loan limit for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans to a period of time greater than\\nan academic year, you may originate a Direct Loan for that longer period of time. For example, a school might offer an\\n1100 clock-hour program and define the academic year as 900 clock hours but could choose to allow students to receive\\njust one annual loan limit for the entire 1100-hour program. In that case, the loan period would correspond to the length\\nof the program, a period of time that is longer than the academic year.\\nDirect Loan Disbursement Requirements\\nFor general guidance on the timing of disbursements made under the Title IV programs, see Volume 3, Chapter 1. For\\nguidance on reporting Title IV program disbursements through the COD System and the rules for making early\\ndisbursements, late disbursements, and retroactive payments, see Volume 4, Chapter 2. In this section we discuss certain\\nother disbursement requirements that are specific to the Direct Loan Program.\\nNote: See the guidance at the end of this chapter for certain exceptions to the normal Direct Loan disbursement\\nrequirements that apply when periods of clinical work are included in a standard term.\\nRequirement for Substantially Equal Disbursements\\nDirect Loans must be disbursed in substantially equal installments, regardless of any difference in costs for different\\npayment periods that are within the same loan period, and no Direct Loan disbursement may exceed one-half of the loan\\nMaximum Loan Period\\n34 CFR 685.301(a)(10)(iv)\\nDetermining Direct Loan Disbursement Dates and Amounts\\n34 CFR 685.303(d)']","['Inclusion of Clinical Work in a Standard Term Periods of medical and education program clinical work which is conducted outside the classroom may not be included in a standard term, unless all of the following apply: All students in the program must participate in the practicum or clinical experience, and they must be required to complete the practicum or clinical experience as a condition for applying for licensure or authorization to practice the occupation they intend to pursue; The school has little or no control over the length or starting and ending dates of the practicum or clinical experience. This may be due to constraints imposed by outside licensing bodies or the need to accommodate schedules of entities with which students are being placed (e.g., school districts or hospitals); and Credit hours associated with the practicum or clinical experience must be associated with the term in which most of the training occurs, even if the starting and ending dates do not exactly align with the term dates and/or overlap with another term. If the clinical work meets all the above criteria, terms which include such clinical work are not required to be considered nonstandard, nor are such programs required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. This flexibility is limited to required clinical periods associated with standard term programs in medicine (including, but not limited to, allopathic, osteopathic, nursing, veterinary, dentistry, pharmacy, and physical therapy), and student teaching required to obtain a state teaching certificate. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for additional guidance on certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets the criteria described above is included in a standard term. Nonstandard Terms Generally, nonstandard terms are terms that are not semesters, trimesters, or quarters. For example, a 5-week term or a 23-week term would be considered a nonstandard term because no standard term can be fewer than nine weeks or greater than 21 weeks in length. Like standard terms, nonstandard terms may be equal in length or may be of different lengths. If a program is offered in a combination of standard terms and nonstandard terms, the program is considered to be offered in nonstandard terms. Also, like standard terms, nonstandard terms may not overlap within a program. Even if a school calls its terms semesters, trimesters, or quarters, they are considered to be nonstandard terms if they do not comply with the policy on standard term length, as described earlier. For instance, a 22-week semester or an 8-week quarter must be treated as a nonstandard term, because a semester cannot contain more than 21 weeks and a quarter must include a minimum of nine weeks. Semesters, trimesters, or quarters are also considered to be nonstandard terms if academic progress is not measured in the manner normally associated with the type of term. For example, if a program is offered in 15-week semesters but measures academic progress in quarter credit hours, the semesters would be considered nonstandard terms.']","According to Volume 8, Chapter 3, the specific exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans occur when clinical work that meets certain criteria is included in a standard term. These exceptions are as follows:

1. **Loan Period Start Date Adjustment**: If clinical work begins before the official start date of the associated term, the loan period start date is set to the beginning date of the clinical work, rather than the term start date.

2. **Loan Period End Date Adjustment**: If clinical work ends after the official end date of the associated term, the loan period end date is set to the clinical work's ending date, rather than the term end date.

3. **Overlap of Loan Periods**: When clinical work spans multiple loan periods, and the clinical work associated with the next period has not yet been completed, it is permissible for the loan periods (and payment periods) to overlap.

4. **Inclusion of Clinical Work in Standard Terms**: Clinical work that meets all the outlined criteria—such as participation by all students, conduct outside the classroom, little control over timing, and credit hours associated with most of the training—can be included in a standard term without causing the term to be considered nonstandard. This inclusion allows for flexibility in loan period and disbursement timing.

**Impact on Federal Student Aid Administration**:
This guidance provides flexibility for programs with required clinical or practicum experiences, such as medical, nursing, dental, veterinary, pharmacy, physical therapy, and student teaching programs. It allows these programs to include clinical work within the standard term framework without being subject to the usual restrictions that might otherwise delay or complicate loan disbursements. As a result, schools can align loan periods more accurately with students' actual clinical training schedules, ensuring timely disbursements and better support for students engaged in clinical education components that are essential to their programs.","Volume 8, Chapter 3 provides additional guidance on certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets the specified criteria is included in a standard term. Specifically, if all students in a program must participate in a practicum or clinical experience as a condition for licensure, the school has little or no control over the length or dates of the clinical experience, and the credit hours are associated with the term in which most training occurs, then the terms including such clinical work are not required to be considered nonstandard, nor are the programs required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term.

Effect of Accelerated Progression on Disbursement Timing in a Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Program The Pell Grant or TEACH Grant amount that a student is eligible to receive for a payment period in a clock-hour or non- term credit-hour program is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods for the program that are established at the beginning of the program based on the program length (as described earlier in this chapter).

Regarding your question about whether the number of weeks or hours completed during the payment period affects the amount of the grant: the TEACH Grant amount is generally fixed and determined at the time of disbursement based on the cost of attendance and other factors, not on the number of weeks or hours completed within a payment period. However, maintaining the eligibility requirements, including completing the program and fulfilling the teaching service obligation, is crucial to avoid having the grant converted into a loan.

This means that if a student completes additional weeks of instructional time or hours\\nwhile completing the other measure of a payment period, the actual number of weeks or hours that the student\\ncompletes before a disbursement can be made for the next payment period may differ from the number of weeks or hours\\nin the scheduled payment period used to determine the student9s grant amount for the payment period.\\nAlthough a student9s completion of additional weeks or hours in a payment period has no effect on the scheduled\\npayment periods for purposes of determining Pell Grant and TEACH Grant payment amounts, an undergraduate student\\nwho accelerates in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final\\nacademic year of a program. Specifically, if a student enrolled in a program that is greater than one academic year in\\nlength completes additional clock or credit hours prior to the final academic year of the program, this may result in a final\\nperiod of study that contains fewer clock or credit hours than the number of hours in the program9s defined academic\\nyear. In this circumstance, the Direct Loan annual loan limit for an undergraduate student must be prorated (reduced).\\nThe principles described above are illustrated by the examples in Appendix A at the end of this chapter. For guidance on\\ncalculating Pell Grant and TEACH Grant awards for clock-hour and non-term credit-hour programs, see Volume 7. For\\ninformation on Direct Loan annual loan limit proration and annual loan limit progression in clock-hour and non-term credit-\\nhour programs, see Volume 8, Chapters 5 and 6.\\nIf your school is unable to determine when a student has successfully completed half of the credit or clock hours in a\\nprogram, academic year, or remainder of a program, the student is considered to have begun the second payment period\\nof the program, academic year, or remainder of a program at the later of the date (identified by your school) that the\\nstudent has successfully completed:\\nhalf of the academic coursework in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program; or\\nhalf of the number of weeks of instructional time in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program.\\nDisbursement Timing in Subscription-Based Programs\\nFor the first two subscription periods (terms) that a student attends in a subscription-based program, there is no\\nrequirement for the student to have completed a certain amount of coursework before receiving a disbursement of Title IV\\nfunds (the same as in any other term-based program using credit hours). However, to receive a disbursement of Title IV\\naid for each subsequent subscription period in the program, the student must have completed a cumulative number of\\ncredit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended\\nsubscription periods in the program, excluding the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in the most\\nrecently attended subscription period. For more detailed guidance on the disbursement rules for subscription-based\\nprograms, including examples, refer to Appendix B at the end of this chapter.\\nMultiple Disbursements Within a Payment Period\\nThe regulations governing the Title IV programs generally permit schools to pay Title IV funds at such times and in such\\ninstallments within each payment period as will best meet students9 needs. This gives schools the ability to apportion the\\npayment if doing so will be in the best interest of the student. For example, if a payment period is particularly long, a\\nschool might choose to pay in multiple installments to the extent program requirements permit to ensure that a student\\nwill have funds to pay rent later in the payment period. If a school chooses to schedule multiple Direct Loan\\ndisbursements within a single payment period, the disbursements must be substantially equal. Note also that if the loan\\nperiod for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless the\\nschool qualifies for an exception to the multiple disbursement requirement. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more', 'At the end of subscription period #7, the student has earned a cumulative total of 69 credit hours. Because 72 hours are\\nrequired for the student to receive a disbursement in subscription period #8, the disbursements for that subscription\\nperiod must be delayed until the student has completed an additional three hours. The student has earned a cumulative\\ntotal of 84 hours at the end of subscription period #8, which is the number of hours required to receive a disbursement for\\nsubscription period #9.

In a standard term or nonstandard term academic calendar, a term is generally a period in which all classes are scheduled to begin and end within a set time frame, and academic progress is measured in credit hours. In a non-term academic calendar, classes do not begin and end within a set time frame, such as a term. Academic progress in a non-term program can be measured in either credit or clock hours. In some cases (as discussed below), a program with terms must be treated as a non-term program for Title IV purposes. A subscription-based academic calendar is used only by subscription-based programs. A subscription-based program is a term-based program in which the school charges a student for each term on a subscription basis with the expectation that the student will complete a specified number of credit hours (or the equivalent) during that term. However, classes in a subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term, as is the case in a term-based calendar that is not subscription-based. For more detail on subscription-based programs, see Volume 2, Chapter 2. A subscription-based academic calendar consists of ""subscription periods"" that are either standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms (for guidance on when terms are considered to be substantially equal in length, see <Payment periods for programs using standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms= later in this chapter). Substantially equal nonstandard terms may be of any length, but if they are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for purposes of monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6 for more information on BBAY 3). Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length are not permissible in a subscription-based academic calendar. The term ""subscription period"" is synonymous with ""term"" and ""payment period"" (payment periods are covered later in this chapter). Except for the fact that classes are not required to start and end within a term, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs. These requirements include: minimum and maximum term length restrictions for standard terms (see the discussion in the next section of this chapter); requirements for determining full-time enrollment (see Volume 1, Chapter 1); use of a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY), BBAY 1, BBAY 2, or BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6); and use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards (see Volume 7, Chapter 4). Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. Standard Terms: Semesters, Trimesters, and Quarters Semesters and trimesters contain between 14 and 21 weeks of instructional time. However, a summer term in a program using semesters or trimesters may contain fewer than 14 weeks. An academic calendar that uses semesters or trimesters traditionally has three terms, one each in the fall, spring, and summer, two of which comprise an academic year. For example, in a program using an SAY calendar, fall and spring would comprise an academic year. In a program using a', '<2-hop>\n\nDisbursement Timing in Subscription-Based Programs For the first two subscription periods (terms) that a student attends in a subscription-based program, there is no requirement for the student to have completed a certain amount of coursework before receiving a disbursement of Title IV funds (the same as in any other term-based program using credit hours). However, to receive a disbursement of Title IV aid for each subsequent subscription period in the program, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods in the program, excluding the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in the most recently attended subscription period. For more detailed guidance on the disbursement rules for subscription-based programs, including examples, refer to Appendix B at the end of this chapter. Multiple Disbursements Within a Payment Period The regulations governing the Title IV programs generally permit schools to pay Title IV funds at such times and in such installments within each payment period as will best meet students9 needs. This gives schools the ability to apportion the payment if doing so will be in the best interest of the student. For example, if a payment period is particularly long, a school might choose to pay in multiple installments to the extent program requirements permit to ensure that a student will have funds to pay rent later in the payment period. If a school chooses to schedule multiple Direct Loan disbursements within a single payment period, the disbursements must be substantially equal. Note also that if the loan period for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless the school qualifies for an exception to the multiple disbursement requirement. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more']","A subscription-based academic calendar affects the timing of disbursement for Title IV aid in the following ways:

- For the first two subscription periods (terms), students can receive disbursements without having completed a certain amount of coursework.
- For each subsequent subscription period, students must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total hours enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods, excluding the most recent period.
- Disbursements for the first two periods can be made up to 10 days before the start of the period.
- Starting with the third subscription period, early disbursement is only permitted if the student has completed the required coursework for that period.
- If a student has not begun attendance in any new coursework during a subscription period, they are ineligible for Title IV funds for that period.
- Once the student has completed enough hours to meet the total program requirements, they are no longer eligible for further disbursements.

The requirements for students to receive disbursements in later subscription periods include completing the necessary cumulative credit hours from previous periods, and meeting attendance and coursework initiation criteria.","in a subscription-based academic calendar, which is used only by subscription-based programs, the timing of title iv aid disbursement is affected by specific requirements. for the first two subscription periods (terms) that a student attends, there is no requirement for the student to have completed a certain amount of coursework before receiving a disbursement of title iv funds, similar to other term-based programs using credit hours. however, for each subsequent subscription period, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods, excluding the most recently attended subscription period. this means that after the first two periods, students must demonstrate completion of prior enrolled credit hours to continue receiving disbursements. additionally, schools may choose to make multiple, substantially equal disbursements within a payment period to best meet students' needs, and if a direct loan period is a single payment period, it must be disbursed in at least two installments unless an exception applies.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer

The key points are:
- The clinical work is conducted outside the classroom and the school has little or no control over its timing.
- Courses that do not begin and end within a set period, such as a term, are characteristic of non-term programs.
- Such clinical work and courses do not meet the criteria for inclusion in a standard term, which requires all courses to be within a set period and the school to have control over start and end dates.

Regarding how non-term program characteristics affect federal aid payment periods:
- Payment periods are generally based on the length and structure of academic terms.
- For non-term programs, especially those with courses that do not follow fixed terms or have overlapping courses, payment periods are often based on the successful completion of clock hours or credit hours and instructional weeks.
- For programs longer than one academic year, payment periods may be divided into multiple segments based on the completion of half the hours and weeks, similar to shorter programs.
- The absence of fixed terms and the presence of courses that overlap or are self-paced lead to more complex and flexible definitions of payment periods, often tied to instructional time and credit hour completion rather than fixed academic terms.

In a standard term or nonstandard term academic calendar, a term is generally a period in which all classes are scheduled to begin and end within a set time frame, and academic progress is measured in credit hours. In a non-term academic calendar, classes do not begin and end within a set time frame, such as a term. Academic progress in a non-term program can be measured in either credit or clock hours. In some cases (as discussed below), a program with terms must be treated as a non-term program for Title IV purposes. A subscription-based academic calendar is used only by subscription-based programs. A subscription-based program is a term-based program in which the school charges a student for each term on a subscription basis with the expectation that the student will complete a specified number of credit hours (or the equivalent) during that term. However, classes in a subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term, as is the case in a term-based calendar that is not subscription-based. For more detail on subscription-based programs, see Volume 2, Chapter 2. A subscription-based academic calendar consists of ""subscription periods"" that are either standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms (for guidance on when terms are considered to be substantially equal in length, see <Payment periods for programs using standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms= later in this chapter). Substantially equal nonstandard terms may be of any length, but if they are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for purposes of monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6 for more information on BBAY 3). Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length are not permissible in a subscription-based academic calendar. The term ""subscription period"" is synonymous with ""term"" and ""payment period"" (payment periods are covered later in this chapter). Except for the fact that classes are not required to start and end within a term, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs. These requirements include: minimum and maximum term length restrictions for standard terms (see the discussion in the next section of this chapter); requirements for determining full-time enrollment (see Volume 1, Chapter 1); use of a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY), BBAY 1, BBAY 2, or BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6); and use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards (see Volume 7, Chapter 4). Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. Standard Terms: Semesters, Trimesters, and Quarters Semesters and trimesters contain between 14 and 21 weeks of instructional time. However, a summer term in a program using semesters or trimesters may contain fewer than 14 weeks. An academic calendar that uses semesters or trimesters traditionally has three terms, one each in the fall, spring, and summer, two of which comprise an academic year. For example, in a program using an SAY calendar, fall and spring would comprise an academic year. In a program using a']","The structure of a subscription-based academic calendar affects the timing and eligibility for Title IV disbursements in the following ways:

1. Initial Subscription Periods: Students can receive Title IV funds without having completed a specific amount of coursework during the first two subscription periods (terms).

2. Subsequent Subscription Periods: Starting from the third subscription period, students must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total hours enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods (excluding the most recent period) to be eligible for disbursement.

3. Progression and Eligibility: The cumulative hours required for disbursement increase with each subscription period, based on the student's enrollment history. Once the total completed hours meet or exceed the total hours in the program, the student is no longer eligible for further Title IV funds.

4. Impact of Enrollment Status: The number of credit hours associated with each subscription period depends on the student's established enrollment status (e.g., full-time or half-time). The program's structure and the student's enrollment status determine the credit hour benchmarks that must be met for disbursement.

5. Attendance in New Coursework: Students must have begun attendance in new coursework during each subscription period to remain eligible. Continuing attendance in previously started coursework without beginning new coursework renders a student ineligible for aid for that period.

6. Disbursement Timing: For the first two periods, disbursements can be made up to 10 days before the start of the period. For subsequent periods, disbursements are only allowed after the student has met the coursework completion requirements.

In summary, the subscription-based calendar creates a phased disbursement process where initial periods are disbursed freely, but subsequent periods require demonstrated coursework progress, measured by cumulative credit hours completed, before aid can be disbursed. This aligns disbursement timing with academic progress and attendance in new coursework.","The structurre of a subscription-based academic calendar, as described in Volume 2, Chapter 2 and referenced in Volume 8, Chapter 3, directly impacts the timing and eligibility for Title IV disbursements. In subscription-based programs, the academic calendar is divided into 'subscription periods,' which are synonymous with terms or payment periods. For the first two subscription periods that a student attends, there is no requirement for the student to have completed a certain amount of coursework before receiving a disbursement of Title IV funds. However, for each subsequent subscription period, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods, excluding the most recently attended period. This means that after the initial two periods, continued eligibility for disbursement is contingent upon the student’s academic progress as measured by completed credit hours. The rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs, except that classes in a subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term.

Effect of Accelerated Progression on Disbursement Timing in a Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Program The Pell Grant or TEACH Grant amount that a student is eligible to receive for a payment period in a clock-hour or non- term credit-hour program is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods for the program that are established at the beginning of the program based on the program length (as described earlier in this chapter). These scheduled payment periods do not change, regardless of a student9s rate of progression through a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program. This means that if a student completes additional weeks of instructional time or hours while completing the other measure of a payment period, the actual number of weeks or hours that the student completes before a disbursement can be made for the next payment period may differ from the number of weeks or hours in the scheduled payment period used to determine the student9s grant amount for the payment period. Although a student9s completion of additional weeks or hours in a payment period has no effect on the scheduled payment periods for purposes of determining Pell Grant and TEACH Grant payment amounts, an undergraduate student who accelerates in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year of a program. Specifically, if a student enrolled in a program that is greater than one academic year in length completes additional clock or credit hours prior to the final academic year of the program, this may result in a final period of study that contains fewer clock or credit hours than the number of hours in the program9s defined academic year. In this circumstance, the Direct Loan annual loan limit for an undergraduate student must be prorated (reduced).

This may be due to constraints imposed by outside licensing bodies or the need to accommodate schedules of entities with which students are being placed (e.g., school districts or hospitals); and Credit hours associated with the practicum or clinical experience must be associated with the term in which most of the training occurs, even if the starting and ending dates do not exactly align with the term dates and/or overlap with another term. If the clinical work meets all the above criteria, terms which include such clinical work are not required to be considered nonstandard, nor are such programs required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. This flexibility is limited to required clinical periods associated with standard term programs in medicine (including, but not limited to, allopathic, osteopathic, nursing, veterinary, dentistry, pharmacy, and physical therapy), and student teaching required to obtain a state teaching certificate. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for additional guidance on certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets the criteria described above is included in a standard term. Nonstandard Terms Generally, nonstandard terms are terms that are not semesters, trimesters, or quarters. For example, a 5-week term or a 23-week term would be considered a nonstandard term because no standard term can be fewer than nine weeks or greater than 21 weeks in length. Like standard terms, nonstandard terms may be equal in length or may be of different lengths. If a program is offered in a combination of standard terms and nonstandard terms, the program is considered to be offered in nonstandard terms. Also, like standard terms, nonstandard terms may not overlap within a program. Even if a school calls its terms semesters, trimesters, or quarters, they are considered to be nonstandard terms if they do not comply with the policy on standard term length, as described earlier. For instance, a 22-week semester or an 8-week quarter must be treated as a nonstandard term, because a semester cannot contain more than 21 weeks and a quarter must include a minimum of nine weeks. Semesters, trimesters, or quarters are also considered to be nonstandard terms if academic progress is not measured in the manner normally associated with the type of term. For example, if a program is offered in 15-week semesters but measures academic progress in quarter credit hours, the semesters would be considered nonstandard terms.']","Based on the information from the official sources:

1. Nonstandard term programs: For students in nonstandard term programs, eligibility for Direct Loans depends on whether the program meets certain instructional time requirements. The program must be treated as a non-term program, and the terms should be substantially equal in length, typically not exceeding 9 weeks of instructional time. If the program meets these criteria, students may be eligible for Direct Loans.

2. Clinical work and accelerated progression: Clinical work can qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), which may impact loan forgiveness options. Accelerated progression, such as completing the program faster, may reduce the overall loan balance through accelerated repayment plans. Additionally, certain discharges like total and permanent disability can eliminate federal student loans.

For specific eligibility and how these factors apply to an individual case, it is advisable to consult the financial aid office or a student loan expert.","If a student in a nonstandard term program receives a Direct Loan, clinical work that meets specific criteria (such as being required for licensure and having little or no school control over its schedule) can be included in a standard term, and exceptions to normal Direct Loan disbursement timing may apply. However, if the student accelerates their progression in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program, they may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year. This is because completing additional hours before the final year can result in a final period with fewer hours than the defined academic year, requiring the Direct Loan annual loan limit to be prorated (reduced).",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

Except for the fact that classes are not required to start and end within a term, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs. These requirements include: minimum and maximum term length restrictions for standard terms (see the discussion in the next section of this chapter); requirements for determining full-time enrollment (see Volume 1, Chapter 1); use of a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY), BBAY 1, BBAY 2, or BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6); and use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards (see Volume 7, Chapter 4). Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. Standard Terms: Semesters, Trimesters, and Quarters Semesters and trimesters contain between 14 and 21 weeks of instructional time. However, a summer term in a program using semesters or trimesters may contain fewer than 14 weeks. An academic calendar that uses semesters or trimesters traditionally has three terms, one each in the fall, spring, and summer, two of which comprise an academic year. For example, in a program using an SAY calendar, fall and spring would comprise an academic year.

This may be due to constraints imposed by outside licensing bodies or the need to accommodate schedules of entities with which students are being placed (e.g., school districts or hospitals); and Credit hours associated with the practicum or clinical experience must be associated with the term in which most of the training occurs, even if the starting and ending dates do not exactly align with the term dates and/or overlap with another term. If the clinical work meets all the above criteria, terms which include such clinical work are not required to be considered nonstandard, nor are such programs required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. This flexibility is limited to required clinical periods associated with standard term programs in medicine (including, but not limited to, allopathic, osteopathic, nursing, veterinary, dentistry, pharmacy, and physical therapy), and student teaching required to obtain a state teaching certificate. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for additional guidance on certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets the criteria described above is included in a standard term. Nonstandard Terms Generally, nonstandard terms are terms that are not semesters, trimesters, or quarters. For example, a 5-week term or a 23-week term would be considered a nonstandard term because no standard term can be fewer than nine weeks or greater than 21 weeks in length. Like standard terms, nonstandard terms may be equal in length or may be of different lengths. If a program is offered in a combination of standard terms and nonstandard terms, the program is considered to be offered in nonstandard terms. Also, like standard terms, nonstandard terms may not overlap within a program. Even if a school calls its terms semesters, trimesters, or quarters, they are considered to be nonstandard terms if they do not comply with the policy on standard term length, as described earlier. For instance, a 22-week semester or an 8-week quarter must be treated as a nonstandard term, because a semester cannot contain more than 21 weeks and a quarter must include a minimum of nine weeks. Semesters, trimesters, or quarters are also considered to be nonstandard terms if academic progress is not measured in the manner normally associated with the type of term. For example, if a program is offered in 15-week semesters but measures academic progress in quarter credit hours, the semesters would be considered nonstandard terms.']","The search results indicate that information about subscription-based programs and exceptions for clinical work in standard terms, including relevant chapters or sections, can be found in federal documents and regulations.
