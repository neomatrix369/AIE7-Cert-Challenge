"How does the structure of an academic calendar, such as standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based, affect the calculation and disbursement of Pell Grant awards?","['non-term (includes clock-hour calendars), or\\nsubscription-based.\\nIn a standard term or nonstandard term academic calendar, a term is generally a period in which all classes are\\nscheduled to begin and end within a set time frame, and academic progress is measured in credit hours.\\nIn a non-term academic calendar, classes do not begin and end within a set time frame, such as a term. Academic\\nprogress in a non-term program can be measured in either credit or clock hours. In some cases (as discussed below), a\\nprogram with terms must be treated as a non-term program for Title IV purposes.\\nA subscription-based academic calendar is used only by subscription-based programs. A subscription-based program\\nis a term-based program in which the school charges a student for each term on a subscription basis with the expectation\\nthat the student will complete a specified number of credit hours (or the equivalent) during that term. However, classes in\\na subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term, as is the case in a\\nterm-based calendar that is not subscription-based. For more detail on subscription-based programs, see Volume 2,\\nChapter 2.\\nA subscription-based academic calendar consists of ""subscription periods"" that are either standard terms or substantially\\nequal nonstandard terms (for guidance on when terms are considered to be substantially equal in length, see <Payment\\nperiods for programs using standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms= later in this chapter). Substantially\\nequal nonstandard terms may be of any length, but if they are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use\\nBBAY 3 for purposes of monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6 for more\\ninformation on BBAY 3).

These requirements\\ninclude:\\nminimum and maximum term length restrictions for standard terms (see the discussion in the next section of this\\nchapter);\\nrequirements for determining full-time enrollment (see Volume 1, Chapter 1);\\nuse of a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY), BBAY 1, BBAY 2, or BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit\\nprogression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6); and\\nuse of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards (see Volume 7, Chapter 4).\\nWhether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for\\nhow aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs.\\nStandard Terms: Semesters, Trimesters, and Quarters\\nSemesters and trimesters contain between 14 and 21 weeks of instructional time. However, a summer term in a program\\nusing semesters or trimesters may contain fewer than 14 weeks. An academic calendar that uses semesters or trimesters\\ntraditionally has three terms, one each in the fall, spring, and summer, two of which comprise an academic year.

In a standard term or nonstandard term academic calendar, a term is generally a period in which all classes are scheduled to begin and end within a set time frame, and academic progress is measured in credit hours. In a non-term academic calendar, classes do not begin and end within a set time frame, such as a term. Academic progress in a non-term program can be measured in either credit or clock hours. In some cases (as discussed below), a program with terms must be treated as a non-term program for Title IV purposes. A subscription-based academic calendar is used only by subscription-based programs. A subscription-based program is a term-based program in which the school charges a student for each term on a subscription basis with the expectation that the student will complete a specified number of credit hours (or the equivalent) during that term. However, classes in a subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term, as is the case in a term-based calendar that is not subscription-based. For more detail on subscription-based programs, see Volume 2, Chapter 2. A subscription-based academic calendar consists of ""subscription periods"" that are either standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms (for guidance on when terms are considered to be substantially equal in length, see <Payment periods for programs using standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms= later in this chapter). Substantially equal nonstandard terms may be of any length, but if they are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for purposes of monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6 for more information on BBAY 3). Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length are not permissible in a subscription-based academic calendar. The term ""subscription period"" is synonymous with ""term"" and ""payment period"" (payment periods are covered later in this chapter). Except for the fact that classes are not required to start and end within a term, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs. These requirements include: minimum and maximum term length restrictions for standard terms (see the discussion in the next section of this chapter); requirements for determining full-time enrollment (see Volume 1, Chapter 1); use of a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY), BBAY 1, BBAY 2, or BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6); and use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards (see Volume 7, Chapter 4). Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. Standard Terms: Semesters, Trimesters, and Quarters Semesters and trimesters contain between 14 and 21 weeks of instructional time. However, a summer term in a program using semesters or trimesters may contain fewer than 14 weeks. An academic calendar that uses semesters or trimesters traditionally has three terms, one each in the fall, spring, and summer, two of which comprise an academic year. For example, in a program using an SAY calendar, fall and spring would comprise an academic year. In a program using a']","The structure of an academic calendar—such as standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based—significantly influences the calculation and disbursement of Pell Grant awards. Here's how:

1. Term Definition and Scheduling:
   - Standard and Nonstandard Terms: These are scheduled periods with defined start and end dates, typically measured in credit hours and weeks of instruction. Pell Grant formulas are applied based on these terms, with specific rules for calculating awards depending on whether the program uses standard or nonstandard terms.
   - Non-term Programs: Classes do not have fixed start and end dates, and progress may be measured in credit or clock hours without specific calendar dates. This can complicate Pell Grant calculations, which often rely on defined terms.
   - Subscription-based Programs: These are term-based but charge students on a subscription basis, with ""subscription periods"" that may be standard or nonstandard. Classes are not required to start or end within specific timeframes, affecting how payment periods are identified and how awards are calculated.

2. Impact on Pell Grant Formulas:
   - Term-based programs (standard or nonstandard) typically calculate Pell Grants based on the scheduled length of the term, enrollment status, and weeks of instruction.
   - Subscription-based programs have similar rules but with more flexibility in scheduling, which can influence disbursement timing and enrollment measurement.

3. Disbursement Timing:
   - Disbursements in standard and nonstandard term programs are often aligned with specific payment periods within each term.
   - In subscription-based programs, disbursements are based on subscription periods, which can vary in length, influencing when and how much aid is disbursed.

4. Monitoring and Eligibility:
   - The calendar structure affects how schools monitor full-time enrollment, determine the academic year, and track progress for Pell Grant eligibility.
   - Subscription periods, which may vary in length, impact how schools monitor student progress and disburse aid.

5. Special Considerations:
   - Non-term and subscription-based calendars may require treating certain programs as non-term for Title IV purposes, which can alter the Pell Grant calculation process.
   - The definition of an academic year, based on weeks of instruction and hours of coursework, interacts with the calendar structure to determine eligibility and award amounts.

In summary, the academic calendar structure determines how Pell Grant awards are calculated by defining relevant payment periods, enrollment status, and progress measurement. It also influences the timing and method of disbursement to ensure aid aligns with the student's actual academic engagement within the program's scheduling framework.","The structure of an academic calendar—whether it is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based—affects how Pell Grant awards are calculated and disbursed. In subscription-based programs, which are term-based but do not require classes to start and end within a specific timeframe, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply. This includes the use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards. The type of academic calendar determines the applicable Pell Grant formula and the timing of aid disbursement under Title IV programs.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
"medicine program clinical work, it gotta be in standard term or not?",[],"['Inclusion of Clinical Work in a Standard Term Periods of medical and education program clinical work which is conducted outside the classroom may not be included in a standard term, unless all of the following apply: All students in the program must participate in the practicum or clinical experience, and they must be required to complete the practicum or clinical experience as a condition for applying for licensure or authorization to practice the occupation they intend to pursue; The school has little or no control over the length or starting and ending dates of the practicum or clinical experience. This may be due to constraints imposed by outside licensing bodies or the need to accommodate schedules of entities with which students are being placed (e.g., school districts or hospitals); and Credit hours associated with the practicum or clinical experience must be associated with the term in which most of the training occurs, even if the starting and ending dates do not exactly align with the term dates and/or overlap with another term. If the clinical work meets all the above criteria, terms which include such clinical work are not required to be considered nonstandard, nor are such programs required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. This flexibility is limited to required clinical periods associated with standard term programs in medicine (including, but not limited to, allopathic, osteopathic, nursing, veterinary, dentistry, pharmacy, and physical therapy), and student teaching required to obtain a state teaching certificate. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for additional guidance on certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets the criteria described above is included in a standard term. Nonstandard Terms Generally, nonstandard terms are terms that are not semesters, trimesters, or quarters. For example, a 5-week term or a 23-week term would be considered a nonstandard term because no standard term can be fewer than nine weeks or greater than 21 weeks in length. Like standard terms, nonstandard terms may be equal in length or may be of different lengths. If a program is offered in a combination of standard terms and nonstandard terms, the program is considered to be offered in nonstandard terms. Also, like standard terms, nonstandard terms may not overlap within a program. Even if a school calls its terms semesters, trimesters, or quarters, they are considered to be nonstandard terms if they do not comply with the policy on standard term length, as described earlier. For instance, a 22-week semester or an 8-week quarter must be treated as a nonstandard term, because a semester cannot contain more than 21 weeks and a quarter must include a minimum of nine weeks. Semesters, trimesters, or quarters are also considered to be nonstandard terms if academic progress is not measured in the manner normally associated with the type of term. For example, if a program is offered in 15-week semesters but measures academic progress in quarter credit hours, the semesters would be considered nonstandard terms.']",Could you please clarify your question a bit more? Are you asking whether clinical work in a medicine program needs to be documented or described using standard medical terminology? Or are you referring to the requirements for clinical work in a specific medicine program? Providing more details will help me give you a more accurate answer.,"If the clinical work in a medicine program meets all the criteria listed—like all students must do it, it's required for licensure, the school don't control the dates, and the credit hours go with the term where most training happens—then terms with that clinical work don't gotta be considered nonstandard, even if the clinical work overlaps another term.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer

However, if your school\\napplies the annual loan limit for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans to a period of time greater than\\nan academic year, you may originate a Direct Loan for that longer period of time. For example, a school might offer an\\n1100 clock-hour program and define the academic year as 900 clock hours but could choose to allow students to receive\\njust one annual loan limit for the entire 1100-hour program.

For the Direct Loan Program only, this\\nsame requirement applies to students who are enrolled in programs with nonstandard terms that are not substantially\\nequal in length.\\nEffect of Accelerated Progression on Disbursement Timing in a Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Program\\nThe Pell Grant or TEACH Grant amount that a student is eligible to receive for a payment period in a clock-hour or non-\\nterm credit-hour program is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods for the program\\nthat are established at the beginning of the program based on the program length (as described earlier in this chapter).\\nThese scheduled payment periods do not change, regardless of a student9s rate of progression through a clock-hour or\\nnon-term credit-hour program.

Specifically, if a student enrolled in a program that is greater than one academic year in\\nlength completes additional clock or credit hours prior to the final academic year of the program, this may result in a final\\nperiod of study that contains fewer clock or credit hours than the number of hours in the program9s defined academic\\nyear. In this circumstance, the Direct Loan annual loan limit for an undergraduate student must be prorated (reduced).\\nThe principles described above are illustrated by the examples in Appendix A at the end of this chapter. For guidance on\\ncalculating Pell Grant and TEACH Grant awards for clock-hour and non-term credit-hour programs, see Volume 7. For\\ninformation on Direct Loan annual loan limit proration and annual loan limit progression in clock-hour and non-term credit-\\nhour programs, see Volume 8, Chapters 5 and 6.\\nIf your school is unable to determine when a student has successfully completed half of the credit or clock hours in a\\nprogram, academic year, or remainder of a program, the student is considered to have begun the second payment period\\nof the program, academic year, or remainder of a program at the later of the date (identified by your school) that the\\nstudent has successfully completed:\\nhalf of the academic coursework in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program; or\\nhalf of the number of weeks of instructional time in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program.\\nDisbursement Timing in Subscription-Based Programs\\nFor the first two subscription periods (terms) that a student attends in a subscription-based program, there is no\\nrequirement for the student to have completed a certain amount of coursework before receiving a disbursement of Title IV\\nfunds (the same as in any other term-based program using credit hours). However, to receive a disbursement of Title IV\\naid for each subsequent subscription period in the program, the student must have completed a cumulative number of\\ncredit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended\\nsubscription periods in the program, excluding the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in the most\\nrecently attended subscription period. For more detailed guidance on the disbursement rules for subscription-based\\nprograms, including examples, refer to Appendix B at the end of this chapter.\\nMultiple Disbursements Within a Payment Period\\nThe regulations governing the Title IV programs generally permit schools to pay Title IV funds at such times and in such\\ninstallments within each payment period as will best meet students9 needs. This gives schools the ability to apportion the\\npayment if doing so will be in the best interest of the student. For example, if a payment period is particularly long, a\\nschool might choose to pay in multiple installments to the extent program requirements permit to ensure that a student\\nwill have funds to pay rent later in the payment period. If a school chooses to schedule multiple Direct Loan\\ndisbursements within a single payment period, the disbursements must be substantially equal. Note also that if the loan\\nperiod for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless the\\nschool qualifies for an exception to the multiple disbursement requirement.

Effect of Accelerated Progression on Disbursement Timing in a Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Program The Pell Grant or TEACH Grant amount that a student is eligible to receive for a payment period in a clock-hour or non- term credit-hour program is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods for the program that are established at the beginning of the program based on the program length (as described earlier in this chapter).

Although a student9s completion of additional weeks or hours in a payment period has no effect on the scheduled payment periods for purposes of determining Pell Grant and TEACH Grant payment amounts, an undergraduate student who accelerates in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year of a program.

However, if a student completes additional weeks or hours beyond the scheduled amount, this may impact other aspects such as Direct Loan eligibility—specifically, it could lead to a prorated (reduced) loan limit in the final academic year.

See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more']","The disbursement timing for federal student aid varies between program types:

**Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Programs:**
- Disbursements are based on the successful completion of specific measures within each payment period.
- A student successfully completes a payment period when they have completed half of the credit or clock hours and half of the weeks of instructional time in the program for the first payment period.
- For subsequent payment periods, students must complete the remaining portion of the program.
- Disbursements are made during each payment period, which are defined based on the student's successful completion of hours and weeks.
- Before a student can receive a disbursement for the next payment period, they must have successfully completed the required hours and weeks of instructional time in the current payment period.

**Subscription-Based Programs:**
- For the first two subscription periods (terms), there is no requirement for students to have completed a certain amount of coursework before receiving disbursements.
- For subsequent subscription periods, students must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total hours for which they were enrolled in all previous subscription periods, excluding the most recent period.
- Disbursements are based on this cumulative completion requirement, ensuring students have demonstrated progress before receiving additional aid.

**Specific Requirements for Subsequent Disbursements:**
- **Clock-Hour or Non-Term Programs:** Students must have completed the scheduled hours and weeks of instructional time in the current payment period before receiving the next disbursement.
- **Subscription-Based Programs:** Students must have completed the cumulative credit hours from all previous subscription periods (excluding the most recent) before receiving subsequent disbursements.

In summary, clock-hour/non-term programs require successful completion of specific hours and weeks within each payment period before disbursing subsequent aid, whereas subscription-based programs require cumulative credit hour completion from prior periods before subsequent disbursements are made.","In clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs, students must complete both the required credit or clock hours and the weeks of instructional time in a payment period before receiving a disbursement of Pell Grant, FSEOG, TEACH Grant, or Direct Loan funds for the next payment period.

If a school cannot determine when a student has completed half of the required hours or weeks, the student is considered to have begun the second payment period at the later of completing half the coursework or half the weeks of instructional time.

In subscription-based programs, for the first two subscription periods, there is no requirement for completion of a certain amount of coursework before receiving a disbursement of Title IV funds.

Specifically, if a student enrolled in a program that is greater than one academic year in\\nlength completes additional clock or credit hours prior to the final academic year of the program, this may result in a final\\nperiod of study that contains fewer clock or credit hours than the number of hours in the program9s defined academic\\nyear. In this circumstance, the Direct Loan annual loan limit for an undergraduate student must be prorated (reduced).\\nThe principles described above are illustrated by the examples in Appendix A at the end of this chapter. For guidance on\\ncalculating Pell Grant and TEACH Grant awards for clock-hour and non-term credit-hour programs, see Volume 7. For\\ninformation on Direct Loan annual loan limit proration and annual loan limit progression in clock-hour and non-term credit-\\nhour programs, see Volume 8, Chapters 5 and 6.\\nIf your school is unable to determine when a student has successfully completed half of the credit or clock hours in a\\nprogram, academic year, or remainder of a program, the student is considered to have begun the second payment period\\nof the program, academic year, or remainder of a program at the later of the date (identified by your school) that the\\nstudent has successfully completed:\\nhalf of the academic coursework in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program; or\\nhalf of the number of weeks of instructional time in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program.\\nDisbursement Timing in Subscription-Based Programs\\nFor the first two subscription periods (terms) that a student attends in a subscription-based program, there is no\\nrequirement for the student to have completed a certain amount of coursework before receiving a disbursement of Title IV\\nfunds (the same as in any other term-based program using credit hours). However, to receive a disbursement of Title IV\\naid for each subsequent subscription period in the program, the student must have completed a cumulative number of\\ncredit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended\\nsubscription periods in the program, excluding the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in the most\\nrecently attended subscription period. For more detailed guidance on the disbursement rules for subscription-based\\nprograms, including examples, refer to Appendix B at the end of this chapter.\\nMultiple Disbursements Within a Payment Period\\nThe regulations governing the Title IV programs generally permit schools to pay Title IV funds at such times and in such\\ninstallments within each payment period as will best meet students9 needs. This gives schools the ability to apportion the\\npayment if doing so will be in the best interest of the student. For example, if a payment period is particularly long, a\\nschool might choose to pay in multiple installments to the extent program requirements permit to ensure that a student\\nwill have funds to pay rent later in the payment period. If a school chooses to schedule multiple Direct Loan\\ndisbursements within a single payment period, the disbursements must be substantially equal. Note also that if the loan\\nperiod for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless the\\nschool qualifies for an exception to the multiple disbursement requirement. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more', 'information.\\nSchools that use payment periods as the basis for their Return of Title IV Funds calculations should note that making\\nmultiple disbursements within a payment period does not create a new or additional payment period. See Volume 5 of the\\nFSA Handbook for information on how withdrawal calculations handle multiple disbursements.\\nDisbursement Rules for Terms With Modules\\nWhen a student is enrolled in a term-based program in which the terms are divided into two or more modules, but the\\nstudent won9t attend the first module, the date when classes begin for making disbursements is the starting date of the\\nfirst module that the student will attend.\\nFor example, the earliest the school can pay a student who is scheduled to begin attendance in the second of three 5-\\nweek modules that make up a semester is 10 days before the first day of the second module (or 30 days after the second\\nmodule begins, if the student is a first-time, first-year borrower and the school does not meet the requirements for an\\nexemption from the delayed disbursement requirement for such students, as described in Volume 4, Chapter 2).\\nVolume 3, Chapter 1, Appendix A: Non-Term Examples\\nVolume 3, Chapter 1, Appendix A, Example 1: Clock-Hour Program Payment Periods 3 Student Must Repeat Course\\nA student enrolls in a 1-year clock-hour program with an academic year (AY) of 900 clock hours and 26 weeks of\\ninstructional time.

The student\\nsuccessfully completes all other courses in the program.\\nThe school cannot make the second Pell and Direct Loan disbursements until the student has successfully\\ncompleted both the clock hours and the weeks of instructional time in the first payment period. Because the\\nstudent must repeat the second course of the program (taking an additional three weeks to do so), the school\\nmust reschedule the date of the second Pell and Direct Loan disbursements.

For the Direct Loan Program only, this same requirement applies to students who are enrolled in programs with nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length. Effect of Accelerated Progression on Disbursement Timing in a Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Program The Pell Grant or TEACH Grant amount that a student is eligible to receive for a payment period in a clock-hour or non- term credit-hour program is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods for the program that are established at the beginning of the program based on the program length (as described earlier in this chapter). These scheduled payment periods do not change, regardless of a student9s rate of progression through a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program. This means that if a student completes additional weeks of instructional time or hours while completing the other measure of a payment period, the actual number of weeks or hours that the student completes before a disbursement can be made for the next payment period may differ from the number of weeks or hours in the scheduled payment period used to determine the student9s grant amount for the payment period. Although a student9s completion of additional weeks or hours in a payment period has no effect on the scheduled payment periods for purposes of determining Pell Grant and TEACH Grant payment amounts, an undergraduate student who accelerates in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year of a program. Specifically, if a student enrolled in a program that is greater than one academic year in length completes additional clock or credit hours prior to the final academic year of the program, this may result in a final period of study that contains fewer clock or credit hours than the number of hours in the program9s defined academic year. In this circumstance, the Direct Loan annual loan limit for an undergraduate student must be prorated (reduced). The principles described above are illustrated by the examples in Appendix A at the end of this chapter. For guidance on calculating Pell Grant and TEACH Grant awards for clock-hour and non-term credit-hour programs, see Volume 7. For information on Direct Loan annual loan limit proration and annual loan limit progression in clock-hour and non-term credit- hour programs, see Volume 8, Chapters 5 and 6. If your school is unable to determine when a student has successfully completed half of the credit or clock hours in a program, academic year, or remainder of a program, the student is considered to have begun the second payment period of the program, academic year, or remainder of a program at the later of the date (identified by your school) that the student has successfully completed: half of the academic coursework in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program; or half of the number of weeks of instructional time in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program.', '<2-hop>\n\nDisbursement Timing in Subscription-Based Programs For the first two subscription periods (terms) that a student attends in a subscription-based program, there is no requirement for the student to have completed a certain amount of coursework before receiving a disbursement of Title IV funds (the same as in any other term-based program using credit hours). However, to receive a disbursement of Title IV aid for each subsequent subscription period in the program, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods in the program, excluding the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in the most recently attended subscription period. For more detailed guidance on the disbursement rules for subscription-based programs, including examples, refer to Appendix B at the end of this chapter. Multiple Disbursements Within a Payment Period The regulations governing the Title IV programs generally permit schools to pay Title IV funds at such times and in such installments within each payment period as will best meet students9 needs.

Note also that if the loan period for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless the school qualifies for an exception to the multiple disbursement requirement. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more']","The disbursement timing requirements for federal student aid differ between clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs and subscription-based programs in several ways:

1. Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Programs:
- Disbursements are scheduled based on the successful completion of specific coursework, clock hours, or weeks of instructional time.
- For programs of one academic year or less, the first payment period is when the student completes half of the credit or clock hours and half of the instructional weeks. The second payment period covers the remainder.
- For programs longer than one academic year, the first payment period follows the same rule for the first year, and subsequent periods are similarly divided.
- Importantly, students do **not** need to have completed coursework or hours before receiving subsequent disbursements; disbursements are tied to scheduled payment periods based on hours and weeks, regardless of actual coursework completion.
- Accelerated progression (completing additional hours or weeks earlier) does not affect the scheduled disbursement dates but may impact eligibility for certain loans, such as the Direct Loan, which may be prorated if the final academic year contains fewer hours.

2. Subscription-Based Programs:
- For the first two subscription periods (terms), there is no requirement for students to have completed coursework before receiving disbursements.
- For subsequent subscription periods, students must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total hours enrolled in all previous periods (excluding the most recent) before receiving further disbursements.

Regarding flexibility in scheduling multiple disbursements within a payment period:
- Schools are permitted to disburse Title IV funds in multiple installments within a payment period if it best meets students' needs.
- Disbursements must be **substantially equal** if multiple disbursements are scheduled within a single payment period.
- For Direct Loans with a loan period that is a single payment period, at least two disbursements are required unless the school qualifies for an exception.
- Schools can also choose to make multiple disbursements without creating new payment periods, allowing for flexible apportionment to support students financially throughout the period.

Would you like more detailed examples or specific guidance on any of these points?","In clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs, students must complete both the required credit or clock hours and the weeks of instructional time in a payment period before they can receive a disbursement of Pell Grant, FSEOG, TEACH Grant, or Direct Loan funds for the next payment period. The scheduled payment periods are established at the beginning of the program and do not change based on a student's rate of progression. If a student accelerates and completes additional weeks or hours, this does not affect the scheduled payment periods for determining grant amounts, but may result in reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year if the last period contains fewer hours than a defined academic year, requiring proration of the annual loan limit. In contrast, for subscription-based programs, there is no requirement for students to complete a certain amount of coursework before receiving disbursements for the first two subscription periods. For subsequent periods, students must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total hours enrolled in all previous subscription periods, excluding the most recent one. Additionally, schools have flexibility to schedule multiple disbursements within a payment period to best meet students' needs, such as splitting payments in longer periods, provided that Direct Loan disbursements within a single payment period are substantially equal and, if the loan period is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless an exception applies.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer

If a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term contains clinical work that meets all the criteria\\nto be included in the term, this may result in certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement rules as\\ndiscussed earlier in this chapter. We discuss these exceptions below.\\nIf clinical work meets the criteria described in Volume 3 to be included in a standard term or SE9W nonstandard\\nterm, the school must associate the clinical work with the term during which the majority of the clinical work occurs.\\nIf a student receives a Direct Loan for a term that includes clinical work and the clinical work begins before the\\nstarting date of the term with which the clinical work is associated, the loan period start date is the beginning date of\\nthe clinical work (rather than the starting date of the term, as would normally be the case).\\nFor example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring\\nsemesters that run from September 1 through May 31, and the fall semester includes clinical work that begins on\\nAugust 15, the school would report the loan period dates as August 15 through May 31.

If the clinical work meets all the above criteria, terms which include such clinical work are not required to be considered nonstandard, nor are such programs required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term.

Payment Periods The payment period is applicable to all Title IV programs except the Federal Work-Study (FWS) Program. For example, Title IV program disbursements (except FWS payments) must be made on a payment period basis, as discussed in detail']","Clinical or practicum experiences required for licensure in medical or education programs can be included in a standard term under specific conditions:

1. All students in the program must participate in the practicum or clinical experience, and it must be a required condition for applying for licensure or authorization to practice.
2. The school has little or no control over the length or start and end dates of the practicum or clinical experience, often due to external licensing bodies or scheduling constraints with placement entities such as hospitals or school districts.
3. The credit hours associated with the practicum or clinical experience must be linked to the term during which most of the training occurs, even if the actual start and end dates do not exactly align with the term dates or overlap with another term.

This inclusion allows the clinical work to be part of a standard term without the program being classified as non-term or nonstandard, even if the clinical work overlaps with another term.

Differences from non-term programs include:

- Non-term programs are characterized by measuring progress in clock hours rather than standard academic units.
- They often have courses that do not begin and end within a set period, overlap multiple terms, or are self-paced or independent study courses.
- They do not conform to the typical length and structure of semesters, trimesters, or quarters (e.g., a 5-week or 23-week term).
- They are offered in a manner that does not align with normal academic progress measurement.

In summary, clinical or practicum experiences can be included in a standard term if they meet the specified criteria, primarily involving participation requirements, scheduling constraints, and linkage to the training period, which distinguishes them from non-term programs that do not follow standard academic scheduling or progress measurement methods.","A practicum or clinical experience required for licensure in a medical or education program can be included in a standard term if all students must participate in it as a condition for licensure, the school has little or no control over its length or dates (often due to external licensing bodies or placement schedules), and the credit hours are associated with the term in which most training occurs, even if the dates do not align exactly with the term or overlap another term. If these criteria are met, the program is not required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. In contrast, non-term programs are defined by characteristics such as measuring progress in clock hours, having courses that do not begin and end within a set term, courses that overlap terms, or self-paced and independent study courses. Thus, while required clinical experiences can be included in standard terms under specific conditions, programs with the non-term characteristics described must be treated as non-term programs.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer

For the Direct Loan Program only, this same requirement applies to students who are enrolled in programs with nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length. Effect of Accelerated Progression on Disbursement Timing in a Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Program The Pell Grant or TEACH Grant amount that a student is eligible to receive for a payment period in a clock-hour or non- term credit-hour program is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods for the program that are established at the beginning of the program based on the program length (as described earlier in this chapter). These scheduled payment periods do not change, regardless of a student9s rate of progression through a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program. This means that if a student completes additional weeks of instructional time or hours while completing the other measure of a payment period, the actual number of weeks or hours that the student completes before a disbursement can be made for the next payment period may differ from the number of weeks or hours in the scheduled payment period used to determine the student9s grant amount for the payment period. Although a student9s completion of additional weeks or hours in a payment period has no effect on the scheduled payment periods for purposes of determining Pell Grant and TEACH Grant payment amounts, an undergraduate student who accelerates in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year of a program. Specifically, if a student enrolled in a program that is greater than one academic year in length completes additional clock or credit hours prior to the final academic year of the program, this may result in a final period of study that contains fewer clock or credit hours than the number of hours in the program9s defined academic year. In this circumstance, the Direct Loan annual loan limit for an undergraduate student must be prorated (reduced). The principles described above are illustrated by the examples in Appendix A at the end of this chapter. For guidance on calculating Pell Grant and TEACH Grant awards for clock-hour and non-term credit-hour programs, see Volume 7. For information on Direct Loan annual loan limit proration and annual loan limit progression in clock-hour and non-term credit- hour programs, see Volume 8, Chapters 5 and 6. If your school is unable to determine when a student has successfully completed half of the credit or clock hours in a program, academic year, or remainder of a program, the student is considered to have begun the second payment period of the program, academic year, or remainder of a program at the later of the date (identified by your school) that the student has successfully completed: half of the academic coursework in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program; or half of the number of weeks of instructional time in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program.', '<2-hop>\n\nDisbursement Timing in Subscription-Based Programs For the first two subscription periods (terms) that a student attends in a subscription-based program, there is no requirement for the student to have completed a certain amount of coursework before receiving a disbursement of Title IV funds (the same as in any other term-based program using credit hours). However, to receive a disbursement of Title IV aid for each subsequent subscription period in the program, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods in the program, excluding the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in the most recently attended subscription period.

Note also that if the loan period for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless the school qualifies for an exception to the multiple disbursement requirement. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more']","The disbursement timing requirements for federal student aid differ between clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs and subscription-based programs in several ways:

**Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Programs:**
- Disbursements are based on the successful completion of scheduled measures such as clock hours and weeks of instructional time established at the beginning of the program.
- For programs one academic year or less, the first disbursement occurs after the student completes half of the scheduled hours and weeks, with subsequent disbursements following the remainder of the program.
- For programs longer than one year, each academic year follows similar rules, with payment periods defined by half of the scheduled hours and weeks.
- Importantly, students are not required to complete coursework or credit hours before receiving subsequent disbursements. Disbursements can be made regardless of whether the student has completed additional hours or weeks beyond the scheduled measures.
- Accelerated progression, such as completing more hours or weeks early, may reduce eligibility for certain loans like Direct Loans in the final year, due to proration of limits.

**Subscription-Based Programs:**
- For the first two subscription periods (terms), there is no requirement for students to have completed a certain amount of coursework before receiving disbursements.
- For subsequent periods, students must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total hours enrolled in all previous periods, excluding the most recent, before receiving further disbursements.

**Flexibility in Scheduling Multiple Disbursements:**
- Schools have the flexibility to schedule multiple disbursements within a payment period to meet students' needs, especially during long payment periods.
- When multiple disbursements are scheduled within a single payment period, they must be substantially equal.
- For Direct Loans with a loan period that is a single payment period, at least two disbursements are required unless an exception applies.
- Schools can disburse funds earlier if more than half of the payment period has elapsed or if other conditions are met, and they can also choose to make multiple disbursements without creating new payment periods.

In summary, clock-hour and non-term programs do not require coursework completion before subsequent disbursements, whereas subscription-based programs require cumulative hours from previous periods. Schools have considerable flexibility to schedule multiple disbursements within a payment period, provided they follow regulatory requirements.","In clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs, students must complete both the required credit or clock hours and the weeks of instructional time in a payment period before they can receive a disbursement of Pell Grant, FSEOG, TEACH Grant, or Direct Loan funds for the next payment period. The scheduled payment periods are established at the beginning of the program and do not change based on a student's rate of progression. If a student accelerates and completes additional weeks or hours, this does not affect the scheduled payment periods for Pell Grant and TEACH Grant amounts, but may result in reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year if the last period contains fewer hours than the defined academic year, requiring proration of the loan limit.

In subscription-based programs, for the first two subscription periods, there is no requirement for the student to complete a certain amount of coursework before receiving a disbursement of Title IV funds. However, for each subsequent subscription period, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total number of hours for which they were enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods, excluding the most recently attended period.

Additionally, schools have flexibility in scheduling multiple disbursements within a payment period for Title IV programs. They may pay funds in such times and installments as best meet students’ needs, such as splitting payments in longer periods to help students manage expenses. If multiple Direct Loan disbursements are scheduled within a single payment period, they must be substantially equal, and if the loan period is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless an exception applies.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer

However, to receive a disbursement of Title IV aid for each subsequent subscription period in the program, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods in the program, excluding the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in the most recently attended subscription period. For more detailed guidance on the disbursement rules for subscription-based programs, including examples, refer to Appendix B at the end of this chapter. Multiple Disbursements Within a Payment Period The regulations governing the Title IV programs generally permit schools to pay Title IV funds at such times and in such installments within each payment period as will best meet students9 needs. This gives schools the ability to apportion the payment if doing so will be in the best interest of the student. For example, if a payment period is particularly long, a school might choose to pay in multiple installments to the extent program requirements permit to ensure that a student will have funds to pay rent later in the payment period. If a school chooses to schedule multiple Direct Loan disbursements within a single payment period, the disbursements must be substantially equal. Note also that if the loan period for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless the school qualifies for an exception to the multiple disbursement requirement. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more']","According to Volume 8, Chapter 3, the inclusion of clinical work in standard term programs affects the classification of terms by allowing certain clinical work to be included in a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term if specific criteria are met. This inclusion provides flexibility in the timing of loan disbursements and the determination of loan periods. 

The criteria for including clinical work are:
- All students in the program must participate in the practicum or clinical experience, which is required for licensure or practice.
- The school has little or no control over the length or schedule of the clinical work, often due to external licensing or scheduling constraints.
- Credit hours associated with the clinical work must be linked to the term during which most of the training occurs, even if the start and end dates overlap with other terms.

When clinical work is included in a standard term, the disbursement timing rules are adjusted as follows:
- If clinical work begins before the start of the associated term, the loan period start date is the beginning date of the clinical work.
- If clinical work begins on or after the start of the term, the loan period start date is the beginning date of the term.
- If clinical work ends after the end of the associated term, the loan period end date is the ending date of the clinical work.
- If clinical work ends on or before the end of the term, the loan period end date is the end date of the term.

These adjustments ensure that the loan period accurately reflects the clinical work schedule, aligning disbursement timing with the clinical work rather than the standard term dates.","Volume 8, Chapter 3 explains that clinical work in standard term programs may be included in a standard term if all students are required to participate as a condition for licensure, the school has little or no control over the practicum’s timing, and credit hours are associated with the term in which most training occurs. If these criteria are met, the terms do not have to be considered nonstandard, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. For Direct Loans, Volume 8, Chapter 3 provides additional guidance on exceptions to normal loan period and disbursement timing rules when such clinical work is included in a standard term.

Of course, no costs associated with winter quarter may be included in the student9s\\nCOA when determining the loan amount the student is eligible to receive for the fall and spring quarters.

For the Direct Loan Program only, this same requirement applies to students who are enrolled in programs with nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length. Effect of Accelerated Progression on Disbursement Timing in a Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Program The Pell Grant or TEACH Grant amount that a student is eligible to receive for a payment period in a clock-hour or non- term credit-hour program is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods for the program that are established at the beginning of the program based on the program length (as described earlier in this chapter). These scheduled payment periods do not change, regardless of a student9s rate of progression through a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program. This means that if a student completes additional weeks of instructional time or hours while completing the other measure of a payment period, the actual number of weeks or hours that the student completes before a disbursement can be made for the next payment period may differ from the number of weeks or hours in the scheduled payment period used to determine the student9s grant amount for the payment period. Although a student9s completion of additional weeks or hours in a payment period has no effect on the scheduled payment periods for purposes of determining Pell Grant and TEACH Grant payment amounts, an undergraduate student who accelerates in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year of a program. Specifically, if a student enrolled in a program that is greater than one academic year in length completes additional clock or credit hours prior to the final academic year of the program, this may result in a final period of study that contains fewer clock or credit hours than the number of hours in the program9s defined academic year. In this circumstance, the Direct Loan annual loan limit for an undergraduate student must be prorated (reduced). The principles described above are illustrated by the examples in Appendix A at the end of this chapter. For guidance on calculating Pell Grant and TEACH Grant awards for clock-hour and non-term credit-hour programs, see Volume 7. For information on Direct Loan annual loan limit proration and annual loan limit progression in clock-hour and non-term credit- hour programs, see Volume 8, Chapters 5 and 6. If your school is unable to determine when a student has successfully completed half of the credit or clock hours in a program, academic year, or remainder of a program, the student is considered to have begun the second payment period of the program, academic year, or remainder of a program at the later of the date (identified by your school) that the student has successfully completed: half of the academic coursework in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program; or half of the number of weeks of instructional time in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program.', '<2-hop>\n\nDisbursement Timing in Subscription-Based Programs For the first two subscription periods (terms) that a student attends in a subscription-based program, there is no requirement for the student to have completed a certain amount of coursework before receiving a disbursement of Title IV funds (the same as in any other term-based program using credit hours). However, to receive a disbursement of Title IV aid for each subsequent subscription period in the program, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods in the program, excluding the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in the most recently attended subscription period.

This gives schools the ability to apportion the\\npayment if doing so will be in the best interest of the student. For example, if a payment period is particularly long, a\\nschool might choose to pay in multiple installments to the extent program requirements permit to ensure that a student\\nwill have funds to pay rent later in the payment period. If a school chooses to schedule multiple Direct Loan\\ndisbursements within a single payment period, the disbursements must be substantially equal. Note also that if the loan\\nperiod for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless the\\nschool qualifies for an exception to the multiple disbursement requirement.

For example, a school might define the academic\\nyear for a program as containing 24 semester hours and 30 weeks of instructional time but have an academic calendar\\nconsisting of four 8-week nonstandard terms (i.e., 32 weeks of instructional time).

For the Direct Loan Program only, this same requirement applies to students who are enrolled in programs with nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length. Effect of Accelerated Progression on Disbursement Timing in a Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Program The Pell Grant or TEACH Grant amount that a student is eligible to receive for a payment period in a clock-hour or non- term credit-hour program is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods for the program that are established at the beginning of the program based on the program length (as described earlier in this chapter). These scheduled payment periods do not change, regardless of a student9s rate of progression through a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program. This means that if a student completes additional weeks of instructional time or hours while completing the other measure of a payment period, the actual number of weeks or hours that the student completes before a disbursement can be made for the next payment period may differ from the number of weeks or hours in the scheduled payment period used to determine the student9s grant amount for the payment period. Although a student9s completion of additional weeks or hours in a payment period has no effect on the scheduled payment periods for purposes of determining Pell Grant and TEACH Grant payment amounts, an undergraduate student who accelerates in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year of a program. Specifically, if a student enrolled in a program that is greater than one academic year in length completes additional clock or credit hours prior to the final academic year of the program, this may result in a final period of study that contains fewer clock or credit hours than the number of hours in the program9s defined academic year. In this circumstance, the Direct Loan annual loan limit for an undergraduate student must be prorated (reduced). The principles described above are illustrated by the examples in Appendix A at the end of this chapter. For guidance on calculating Pell Grant and TEACH Grant awards for clock-hour and non-term credit-hour programs, see Volume 7. For information on Direct Loan annual loan limit proration and annual loan limit progression in clock-hour and non-term credit- hour programs, see Volume 8, Chapters 5 and 6. If your school is unable to determine when a student has successfully completed half of the credit or clock hours in a program, academic year, or remainder of a program, the student is considered to have begun the second payment period of the program, academic year, or remainder of a program at the later of the date (identified by your school) that the student has successfully completed: half of the academic coursework in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program; or half of the number of weeks of instructional time in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program.', '<2-hop>\n\nnon-term (includes clock-hour calendars), or subscription-based. In a standard term or nonstandard term academic calendar, a term is generally a period in which all classes are scheduled to begin and end within a set time frame, and academic progress is measured in credit hours. In a non-term academic calendar, classes do not begin and end within a set time frame, such as a term. Academic progress in a non-term program can be measured in either credit or clock hours. In some cases (as discussed below), a program with terms must be treated as a non-term program for Title IV purposes. A subscription-based academic calendar is used only by subscription-based programs. A subscription-based program is a term-based program in which the school charges a student for each term on a subscription basis with the expectation that the student will complete a specified number of credit hours (or the equivalent) during that term. However, classes in a subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term, as is the case in a term-based calendar that is not subscription-based. For more detail on subscription-based programs, see Volume 2, Chapter 2. A subscription-based academic calendar consists of ""subscription periods"" that are either standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms (for guidance on when terms are considered to be substantially equal in length, see <Payment periods for programs using standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms= later in this chapter). Substantially equal nonstandard terms may be of any length, but if they are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for purposes of monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6 for more information on BBAY 3). Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length are not permissible in a subscription-based academic calendar. The term ""subscription period"" is synonymous with ""term"" and ""payment period"" (payment periods are covered later in this chapter). Except for the fact that classes are not required to start and end within a term, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs. These requirements include: minimum and maximum term length restrictions for standard terms (see the discussion in the next section of this chapter); requirements for determining full-time enrollment (see Volume 1, Chapter 1); use of a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY), BBAY 1, BBAY 2, or BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6); and use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards (see Volume 7, Chapter 4). Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. Standard Terms: Semesters, Trimesters, and Quarters Semesters and trimesters contain between 14 and 21 weeks of instructional time. However, a summer term in a program using semesters or trimesters may contain fewer than 14 weeks. An academic calendar that uses semesters or trimesters traditionally has three terms, one each in the fall, spring, and summer, two of which comprise an academic year. For example, in a program using an SAY calendar, fall and spring would comprise an academic year. In a program using a']","The structure of non-term and subscription-based academic calendars significantly influences the calculation and disbursement of Pell Grant awards in clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs. 

For non-term programs, the Pell award is always based on the full-time Scheduled Award, regardless of whether the student is attending full or part time, unless the student is enrolled less than half time. Disbursements are made in installments over the established payment periods, which are determined based on the program's length and schedule, not on the student's rate of progression. The scheduled payment periods do not change if a student accelerates or completes additional hours or weeks earlier than scheduled, but acceleration may impact other aid limits, such as Direct Loan eligibility.

Subscription-based programs differ in that disbursements for the first two subscription periods do not require the student to have completed a certain amount of coursework. For subsequent periods, disbursements depend on the student having completed a cumulative number of credit hours from previous periods, excluding the most recent one.

The academic calendar's structure—whether standard term, nonstandard term, or non-term—affects how weeks of instructional time are counted and, consequently, how Pell awards are calculated and disbursed. For example, in non-term or nonstandard term calendars, the timing of disbursements and the calculation of the academic year may not align with traditional semester or quarter schedules, which can influence the timing of disbursements and the amount awarded.

In summary, non-term and subscription-based calendars, by their nature, alter the timing, calculation basis, and disbursement schedule of Pell Grants. Non-term programs rely on fixed scheduled payment periods regardless of acceleration, while subscription-based programs depend on cumulative coursework completion. The calendar type determines how weeks of instruction are counted and how the academic year is defined, impacting the overall award calculation and disbursement process.","The structure of non-term and subscription-based academic calendars directly impacts the calculation and disbursement of Pell Grant awards in clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs. In non-term academic calendars, classes do not begin and end within a set timeframe, and academic progress can be measured in either credit or clock hours. For Pell Grant awards in these programs, the amount a student is eligible to receive for a payment period is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods established at the beginning of the program. These scheduled payment periods do not change, regardless of a student’s rate of progression. In subscription-based programs, which are a type of term-based program, Pell Grant awards are calculated using Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3, and the term 'subscription period' is synonymous with 'term' and 'payment period.' The rules for term-based programs also apply to subscription-based programs, including requirements for determining full-time enrollment and the use of specific academic year structures. Therefore, the academic calendar type determines both the method for calculating Pell Grant awards and the timing of disbursements under Title IV regulations.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

In some cases (as discussed below), a program with terms must be treated as a non-term program for Title IV purposes. A subscription-based academic calendar is used only by subscription-based programs. A subscription-based program is a term-based program in which the school charges a student for each term on a subscription basis with the expectation that the student will complete a specified number of credit hours (or the equivalent) during that term. However, classes in a subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term, as is the case in a term-based calendar that is not subscription-based. For more detail on subscription-based programs, see Volume 2, Chapter 2. A subscription-based academic calendar consists of ""subscription periods"" that are either standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms (for guidance on when terms are considered to be substantially equal in length, see <Payment periods for programs using standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms= later in this chapter). Substantially equal nonstandard terms may be of any length, but if they are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for purposes of monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6 for more information on BBAY 3). Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length are not permissible in a subscription-based academic calendar. The term ""subscription period"" is synonymous with ""term"" and ""payment period"" (payment periods are covered later in this chapter). Except for the fact that classes are not required to start and end within a term, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs. These requirements include: minimum and maximum term length restrictions for standard terms (see the discussion in the next section of this chapter); requirements for determining full-time enrollment (see Volume 1, Chapter 1); use of a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY), BBAY 1, BBAY 2, or BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6); and use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards (see Volume 7, Chapter 4). Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. Standard Terms: Semesters, Trimesters, and Quarters Semesters and trimesters contain between 14 and 21 weeks of instructional time. However, a summer term in a program using semesters or trimesters may contain fewer than 14 weeks. An academic calendar that uses semesters or trimesters traditionally has three terms, one each in the fall, spring, and summer, two of which comprise an academic year. For example, in a program using an SAY calendar, fall and spring would comprise an academic year. In a program using a']","In subscription-based programs, disbursement timing and academic progress requirements differ from those in standard term or non-term academic calendars in several ways:

1. Disbursement Timing:
   - For the first two subscription periods (terms), students can receive Title IV disbursements without having completed a specific amount of coursework.
   - Starting from the third subscription period, students must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total hours enrolled in all previous subscription periods (excluding the most recent) to qualify for disbursement.
   - Disbursements for subsequent periods are delayed until the student meets this coursework completion requirement.
   - Early disbursement (up to 10 days before the start of the period) is permitted for the first two periods. For later periods, early disbursement is only allowed if the student has already completed the required coursework.

2. Use of Subscription Periods and BBAY 3:
   - Subscription periods are flexible and are not bound by fixed start and end dates, unlike traditional terms.
   - These periods are used to define the academic calendar, and they can be standard or substantially equal nonstandard terms.
   - BBAY 3 (Borrower-Based Academic Year 3) can be used for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression, especially when subscription periods are not of standard length.

3. Multiple Disbursements Within a Payment Period:
   - Schools can make multiple disbursements within a single payment period if they are substantially equal.
   - This flexibility allows aid to be apportioned to meet students' needs during long or variable-length subscription periods.

In contrast, standard term or non-term calendars typically require students to complete a minimum amount of coursework or instructional time before each disbursement, with disbursements often aligned with the start of each fixed term. Disbursements are generally less flexible and are scheduled based on fixed calendar dates and coursework completion within those fixed periods.

Overall, subscription-based programs offer more flexible disbursement timing aligned with student progress over multiple subscription periods, utilizing tools like subscription periods, BBAY 3, and multiple disbursements within a payment period to accommodate nonstandard schedules.","In subscription-based programs, as described in Volume 8, Chapter 6 and referenced in Volume 8, Chapter 3, the disbursement timing for Title IV aid differs from standard term or non-term academic calendars. For the first two subscription periods, students are not required to complete a certain amount of coursework before receiving Title IV funds, similar to other term-based programs using credit hours. However, for subsequent subscription periods, students must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods, excluding the most recent one, to receive further disbursements. Subscription-based programs use 'subscription periods,' which are synonymous with 'terms' or 'payment periods,' and these can be standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms. If nonstandard terms are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression. Additionally, schools may choose to make multiple disbursements within a payment period, but if they do so for Direct Loans, the disbursements must be substantially equal, and if the loan period is a single payment period, at least two installments are required unless an exception applies. These requirements ensure that aid is awarded and disbursed in accordance with the unique structure of subscription-based programs, as opposed to the more rigid timing and progress requirements in standard term or non-term calendars.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
