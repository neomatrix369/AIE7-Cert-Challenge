"How does the structure of an academic calendar, such as standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based, affect the calculation and disbursement of Pell Grant awards?",[],"['non-term (includes clock-hour calendars), or subscription-based. In a standard term or nonstandard term academic calendar, a term is generally a period in which all classes are scheduled to begin and end within a set time frame, and academic progress is measured in credit hours. In a non-term academic calendar, classes do not begin and end within a set time frame, such as a term. Academic progress in a non-term program can be measured in either credit or clock hours. In some cases (as discussed below), a program with terms must be treated as a non-term program for Title IV purposes. A subscription-based academic calendar is used only by subscription-based programs. A subscription-based program is a term-based program in which the school charges a student for each term on a subscription basis with the expectation that the student will complete a specified number of credit hours (or the equivalent) during that term. However, classes in a subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term, as is the case in a term-based calendar that is not subscription-based. For more detail on subscription-based programs, see Volume 2, Chapter 2. A subscription-based academic calendar consists of ""subscription periods"" that are either standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms (for guidance on when terms are considered to be substantially equal in length, see <Payment periods for programs using standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms= later in this chapter). Substantially equal nonstandard terms may be of any length, but if they are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for purposes of monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6 for more information on BBAY 3). Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length are not permissible in a subscription-based academic calendar. The term ""subscription period"" is synonymous with ""term"" and ""payment period"" (payment periods are covered later in this chapter). Except for the fact that classes are not required to start and end within a term, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs. These requirements include: minimum and maximum term length restrictions for standard terms (see the discussion in the next section of this chapter); requirements for determining full-time enrollment (see Volume 1, Chapter 1); use of a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY), BBAY 1, BBAY 2, or BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6); and use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards (see Volume 7, Chapter 4). Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. Standard Terms: Semesters, Trimesters, and Quarters Semesters and trimesters contain between 14 and 21 weeks of instructional time. However, a summer term in a program using semesters or trimesters may contain fewer than 14 weeks. An academic calendar that uses semesters or trimesters traditionally has three terms, one each in the fall, spring, and summer, two of which comprise an academic year. For example, in a program using an SAY calendar, fall and spring would comprise an academic year. In a program using a']","The structure of an academic calendar can significantly influence the calculation and disbursement of Pell Grant awards. Here's how different calendar types impact these processes:

1. Standard Term Calendar:
- Definition: Consists of fixed academic periods such as semesters or quarters.
- Impact on Pell Grants:
  - Disbursement is typically aligned with each term, often in multiple payments.
  - The award amount is calculated based on the number of credit hours enrolled and the length of the term.
  - Students may receive disbursements at the start of each term, provided they meet eligibility and enrollment requirements.

2. Nonstandard Term Calendar:
- Definition: Includes terms that are shorter or irregular, such as mini-mesters or accelerated sessions.
- Impact:
  - Disbursement schedules are adjusted to match the specific start and end dates of these terms.
  - The Pell Grant amount may be prorated based on the length of the term relative to a standard academic year.
  - Institutions must carefully calculate the award proportionally to ensure accurate disbursement.

3. Non-term Calendar:
- Definition: Comprises continuous enrollment models without distinct academic terms, such as year-round or rolling admissions.
- Impact:
  - Disbursement may be more flexible, often based on monthly or periodic enrollment.
  - The calculation of Pell Grants may involve prorating the award based on the actual period of enrollment.
  - Ensures that students receive funds proportionally to their period of attendance.

4. Subscription-based Calendar:
- Definition: Students pay a fixed fee for ongoing access to courses or services, rather than traditional enrollment periods.
- Impact:
  - Pell Grant disbursement may be less straightforward, as traditional term-based calculations do not apply.
  - Institutions may need to establish custom disbursement policies aligned with the subscription model.
  - The focus shifts from term-based eligibility to continuous enrollment and attendance.

Overall, the key factors affected by the academic calendar structure include the timing of disbursements, the calculation of award amounts (full or prorated), and the administrative processes required to ensure compliance with federal regulations. Institutions must adapt their financial aid procedures to accurately reflect these calendar types to ensure students receive the correct Pell Grant amounts at appropriate times.","The structure of an academic calendar—whether it is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based—affects how Pell Grant awards are calculated and disbursed. In subscription-based programs, which are term-based but do not require classes to start and end within a specific timeframe, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply. This includes the use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards. The type of academic calendar determines the applicable Pell Grant formula and the timing of aid disbursement under Title IV programs.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
"medicine program clinical work, it gotta be in standard term or not?",[],"['Inclusion of Clinical Work in a Standard Term Periods of medical and education program clinical work which is conducted outside the classroom may not be included in a standard term, unless all of the following apply: All students in the program must participate in the practicum or clinical experience, and they must be required to complete the practicum or clinical experience as a condition for applying for licensure or authorization to practice the occupation they intend to pursue; The school has little or no control over the length or starting and ending dates of the practicum or clinical experience. This may be due to constraints imposed by outside licensing bodies or the need to accommodate schedules of entities with which students are being placed (e.g., school districts or hospitals); and Credit hours associated with the practicum or clinical experience must be associated with the term in which most of the training occurs, even if the starting and ending dates do not exactly align with the term dates and/or overlap with another term. If the clinical work meets all the above criteria, terms which include such clinical work are not required to be considered nonstandard, nor are such programs required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. This flexibility is limited to required clinical periods associated with standard term programs in medicine (including, but not limited to, allopathic, osteopathic, nursing, veterinary, dentistry, pharmacy, and physical therapy), and student teaching required to obtain a state teaching certificate. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for additional guidance on certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets the criteria described above is included in a standard term. Nonstandard Terms Generally, nonstandard terms are terms that are not semesters, trimesters, or quarters. For example, a 5-week term or a 23-week term would be considered a nonstandard term because no standard term can be fewer than nine weeks or greater than 21 weeks in length. Like standard terms, nonstandard terms may be equal in length or may be of different lengths. If a program is offered in a combination of standard terms and nonstandard terms, the program is considered to be offered in nonstandard terms. Also, like standard terms, nonstandard terms may not overlap within a program. Even if a school calls its terms semesters, trimesters, or quarters, they are considered to be nonstandard terms if they do not comply with the policy on standard term length, as described earlier. For instance, a 22-week semester or an 8-week quarter must be treated as a nonstandard term, because a semester cannot contain more than 21 weeks and a quarter must include a minimum of nine weeks. Semesters, trimesters, or quarters are also considered to be nonstandard terms if academic progress is not measured in the manner normally associated with the type of term. For example, if a program is offered in 15-week semesters but measures academic progress in quarter credit hours, the semesters would be considered nonstandard terms.']","In the context of a medicine program, clinical work is typically described using standard medical and academic terminology. Using standard terms ensures clarity, professionalism, and consistency, especially when communicating with academic institutions, healthcare professionals, or in official documentation. However, if you are referring to a specific requirement or guideline, please provide more details so I can give a more precise answer.","If the clinical work in a medicine program meets all the criteria listed—like all students must do it, it's required for licensure, the school don't control the dates, and the credit hours go with the term where most training happens—then terms with that clinical work don't gotta be considered nonstandard, even if the clinical work overlaps another term.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer

Effect of Accelerated Progression on Disbursement Timing in a Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Program The Pell Grant or TEACH Grant amount that a student is eligible to receive for a payment period in a clock-hour or non- term credit-hour program is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods for the program that are established at the beginning of the program based on the program length (as described earlier in this chapter). These scheduled payment periods do not change, regardless of a student9s rate of progression through a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program. This means that if a student completes additional weeks of instructional time or hours while completing the other measure of a payment period, the actual number of weeks or hours that the student completes before a disbursement can be made for the next payment period may differ from the number of weeks or hours in the scheduled payment period used to determine the student9s grant amount for the payment period. Although a student9s completion of additional weeks or hours in a payment period has no effect on the scheduled payment periods for purposes of determining Pell Grant and TEACH Grant payment amounts, an undergraduate student who accelerates in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year of a program. Specifically, if a student enrolled in a program that is greater than one academic year in length completes additional clock or credit hours prior to the final academic year of the program, this may result in a final period of study that contains fewer clock or credit hours than the number of hours in the program9s defined academic year. In this circumstance, the Direct Loan annual loan limit for an undergraduate student must be prorated (reduced).

If your school is unable to determine when a student has successfully completed half of the credit or clock hours in a program, academic year, or remainder of a program, the student is considered to have begun the second payment period of the program, academic year, or remainder of a program at the later of the date (identified by your school) that the student has successfully completed: half of the academic coursework in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program; or half of the number of weeks of instructional time in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program.']","The disbursement of TEACH Grant funds for clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs is typically scheduled in multiple installments throughout the academic year, with specific dates and amounts determined by the school's schedule. If a student completes more weeks or hours than originally scheduled in a payment period, it generally does not change the amount of the TEACH Grant they receive or the timing of the next disbursement. The disbursement schedule is based on the school's academic calendar and the student's enrollment status, not on the actual hours or weeks completed beyond the schedule.

However, it's important for students to stay in contact with their school's financial aid office and review their award disclosures to understand any specific implications for their situation. If a student goes faster than normal, it typically does not affect the disbursement schedule, but any changes in enrollment status or program requirements should be communicated to the financial aid office to ensure proper processing.

Multiple Disbursements Within a Payment Period The regulations governing the Title IV programs generally permit schools to pay Title IV funds at such times and in such installments within each payment period as will best meet students9 needs. This gives schools the ability to apportion the payment if doing so will be in the best interest of the student. For example, if a payment period is particularly long, a school might choose to pay in multiple installments to the extent program requirements permit to ensure that a student will have funds to pay rent later in the payment period. If a school chooses to schedule multiple Direct Loan disbursements within a single payment period, the disbursements must be substantially equal. Note also that if the loan period for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless the school qualifies for an exception to the multiple disbursement requirement. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more']","The disbursement timing for federal student aid differs between program types as follows:

1. **Clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs**: Disbursements are based on completing specific portions of the program. The first payment period is disbursed after the student completes half of the credit hours and instructional time in that period. The second payment covers the remaining program duration. Payments made within 120 days of disbursement are applied to the principal balance.

2. **Subscription-based programs**: Disbursements occur when funds are sent to the school, and the school applies these funds to the student's loans. Similar to other programs, payments made within 120 days of disbursement are applied to the principal. The specific timing of disbursements depends on the school's schedule, and students should contact their school's financial aid office for detailed timing.

**Specific requirements for subsequent disbursements**:
- For both program types, students must meet certain conditions, such as maintaining satisfactory academic progress and completing required coursework, before receiving subsequent disbursements.
- The disbursement process is also contingent upon the student’s continued eligibility and the school’s compliance with federal disbursement policies.

For more detailed information, students should consult their school's financial aid office or the official resources at [studentaid.gov](https://studentaid.gov).","In clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs, students must complete both the required credit or clock hours and the weeks of instructional time in a payment period before receiving a disbursement of Pell Grant, FSEOG, TEACH Grant, or Direct Loan funds for the next payment period.

If a student accelerates and completes additional hours or weeks, it does not affect the scheduled payment periods for Pell Grant and TEACH Grant amounts, but may result in proration of Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year if fewer hours remain. If a school cannot determine when a student has completed half of the required hours or weeks, the student is considered to have begun the second payment period at the later of completing half the coursework or half the weeks of instructional time.

For more detailed guidance on the disbursement rules for subscription-based programs, including examples, refer to Appendix B at the end of this chapter. Multiple Disbursements Within a Payment Period The regulations governing the Title IV programs generally permit schools to pay Title IV funds at such times and in such installments within each payment period as will best meet students9 needs. This gives schools the ability to apportion the payment if doing so will be in the best interest of the student. For example, if a payment period is particularly long, a school might choose to pay in multiple installments to the extent program requirements permit to ensure that a student will have funds to pay rent later in the payment period. If a school chooses to schedule multiple Direct Loan disbursements within a single payment period, the disbursements must be substantially equal. Note also that if the loan period for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless the school qualifies for an exception to the multiple disbursement requirement. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more']","The disbursement timing requirements for federal student aid differ between program types as follows:

1. Clock-hour or Non-term Credit-hour Programs:
- Disbursements are typically based on the completion of credit hours or instructional time.
- Aid is generally disbursed in two payments, aligned with half-year credit and time completion.
- For non-standard terms, disbursements must still align with the completion of half-year credit hours or instructional time.

2. Subscription-based Programs:
- Disbursements occur monthly, usually in December, March, July, and September.
- The timing depends on the school's reconciliation and fund draw-down processes, rather than specific coursework completion milestones.

Regarding flexibility in scheduling multiple disbursements within a payment period:
- Schools have some flexibility to schedule multiple disbursements within a payment period, but these must adhere to federal regulations and the specific disbursement requirements based on the program type.
- For clock-hour or non-term programs, disbursements are tied to credit or instructional time milestones.
- For subscription-based programs, disbursements are aligned with the monthly schedule, which can be adjusted within the bounds of the school's reconciliation process.

The scheduled payment periods are established at the beginning of the program and do not change based on a student's rate of progression. If a student accelerates and completes additional weeks or hours, this does not affect the scheduled payment periods for determining grant amounts, but may result in reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year if the last period contains fewer hours than a defined academic year, requiring proration of the annual loan limit. In contrast, for subscription-based programs, there is no requirement for students to complete a certain amount of coursework before receiving disbursements for the first two subscription periods. For subsequent periods, students must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total hours enrolled in all previous subscription periods, excluding the most recent one. Additionally, schools have flexibility to schedule multiple disbursements within a payment period to best meet students' needs, such as splitting payments in longer periods, provided that Direct Loan disbursements within a single payment period are substantially equal and, if the loan period is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless an exception applies.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer

This may be due to constraints imposed by outside licensing bodies or the need to accommodate schedules of entities with which students are being placed (e.g., school districts or hospitals); and Credit hours associated with the practicum or clinical experience must be associated with the term in which most of the training occurs, even if the starting and ending dates do not exactly align with the term dates and/or overlap with another term. If the clinical work meets all the above criteria, terms which include such clinical work are not required to be considered nonstandard, nor are such programs required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. This flexibility is limited to required clinical periods associated with standard term programs in medicine (including, but not limited to, allopathic, osteopathic, nursing, veterinary, dentistry, pharmacy, and physical therapy), and student teaching required to obtain a state teaching certificate. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for additional guidance on certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets the criteria described above is included in a standard term. Nonstandard Terms Generally, nonstandard terms are terms that are not semesters, trimesters, or quarters. For example, a 5-week term or a 23-week term would be considered a nonstandard term because no standard term can be fewer than nine weeks or greater than 21 weeks in length. Like standard terms, nonstandard terms may be equal in length or may be of different lengths. If a program is offered in a combination of standard terms and nonstandard terms, the program is considered to be offered in nonstandard terms. Also, like standard terms, nonstandard terms may not overlap within a program. Even if a school calls its terms semesters, trimesters, or quarters, they are considered to be nonstandard terms if they do not comply with the policy on standard term length, as described earlier. For instance, a 22-week semester or an 8-week quarter must be treated as a nonstandard term, because a semester cannot contain more than 21 weeks and a quarter must include a minimum of nine weeks. Semesters, trimesters, or quarters are also considered to be nonstandard terms if academic progress is not measured in the manner normally associated with the type of term. For example, if a program is offered in 15-week semesters but measures academic progress in quarter credit hours, the semesters would be considered nonstandard terms.', '<2-hop>\n\nNon-Term Characteristics A program that measures progress in clock hours is always treated as a non-term program.

For the Direct Loan Program only, this same requirement applies to students who are enrolled in programs with nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length. Effect of Accelerated Progression on Disbursement Timing in a Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Program The Pell Grant or TEACH Grant amount that a student is eligible to receive for a payment period in a clock-hour or non- term credit-hour program is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods for the program that are established at the beginning of the program based on the program length (as described earlier in this chapter). These scheduled payment periods do not change, regardless of a student9s rate of progression through a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program. This means that if a student completes additional weeks of instructional time or hours while completing the other measure of a payment period, the actual number of weeks or hours that the student completes before a disbursement can be made for the next payment period may differ from the number of weeks or hours in the scheduled payment period used to determine the student9s grant amount for the payment period. Although a student9s completion of additional weeks or hours in a payment period has no effect on the scheduled payment periods for purposes of determining Pell Grant and TEACH Grant payment amounts, an undergraduate student who accelerates in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year of a program. Specifically, if a student enrolled in a program that is greater than one academic year in length completes additional clock or credit hours prior to the final academic year of the program, this may result in a final period of study that contains fewer clock or credit hours than the number of hours in the program9s defined academic year. In this circumstance, the Direct Loan annual loan limit for an undergraduate student must be prorated (reduced). The principles described above are illustrated by the examples in Appendix A at the end of this chapter. For guidance on calculating Pell Grant and TEACH Grant awards for clock-hour and non-term credit-hour programs, see Volume 7.

See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more']","The disbursement timing requirements for federal student aid differ between program types as follows:

1. **Clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs**: These programs are eligible for federal aid and typically follow a 120-day rule for disbursements. Payments made within 120 days of disbursement are applied to reduce the principal loan amount. Disbursements are generally scheduled after the student has completed a certain amount of coursework or credit hours, ensuring that the student is actively engaged in the program before receiving subsequent disbursements. Schools must ensure that students maintain satisfactory academic progress to continue receiving aid.

2. **Subscription-based programs**: These are not typically applicable to federal student aid. The disbursement timing for such programs varies depending on the specific program's policies. Generally, federal loans disburse after enrollment is confirmed, but the exact timing can differ. Since subscription-based programs are not covered under federal aid regulations, their disbursement schedules are determined by the program providers.

Regarding the flexibility schools have in scheduling multiple disbursements within a payment period:

- Schools have some flexibility to schedule multiple disbursements within a payment period, provided they adhere to federal regulations. Disbursements must be scheduled in a manner that aligns with the student's progress and the program's structure. For instance, disbursements can be made at regular intervals or after specific milestones, such as completing a certain number of credit hours or coursework units.

- Schools must also ensure that disbursements are made in accordance with the student's academic progress and that they do not disburse funds before the student is eligible or before the student has completed the necessary coursework or credit hours.

In summary, for clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs, disbursements are tied to coursework completion and are subject to the 120-day rule, while subscription-based programs have variable timing based on the specific program. Schools have some discretion in scheduling multiple disbursements, provided they comply with federal regulations and the student's academic progress.","In clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs, students must complete both the required credit or clock hours and the weeks of instructional time in a payment period before they can receive a disbursement of Pell Grant, FSEOG, TEACH Grant, or Direct Loan funds for the next payment period.

In subscription-based programs, for the first two subscription periods, there is no requirement for the student to complete a certain amount of coursework before receiving a disbursement of Title IV funds. However, for each subsequent subscription period, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total number of hours for which they were enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods, excluding the most recently attended period.

Additionally, schools have flexibility in scheduling multiple disbursements within a payment period for Title IV programs. They may pay funds in such times and installments as best meet students’ needs, such as splitting payments in longer periods to help students manage expenses.

How does the structure of non-term and subscription-based academic calendars affect the calculation and disbursement of Pell Grant awards in clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs?,"[""The structure of non-term and subscription-based academic calendars influences the calculation and disbursement of Pell Grant awards in clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs by affecting how payment periods are determined and how the academic year is defined. Since these programs may not align with standard academic calendars—often consisting of nonstandard terms or continuous enrollment—the timing of disbursements and the calculation of awards are adjusted accordingly. Specifically, the academic year for such programs may be based on the total number of clock hours or instructional time rather than traditional semester or quarter dates. This means Pell Grants are paid in installments over these nonstandard periods, and the full-time Scheduled Award is used as the basis for the annual award, regardless of actual part-time enrollment, unless the student is enrolled less than half time. Additionally, if the program's calendar does not match the school's academic calendar, it can impact the calculation of Pell Grant awards and the timing of disbursements, as the payment periods are determined by the specific structure of the program rather than the standard academic calendar.""]","['<1-hop>\n\nboth the credit or clock hours and the weeks of instructional time in a payment period before receiving a disbursement of Pell Grant, FSEOG, TEACH Grant or Direct Loan funds for the next payment period. For the Direct Loan Program only, this same requirement applies to students who are enrolled in programs with nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length. Effect of Accelerated Progression on Disbursement Timing in a Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Program The Pell Grant or TEACH Grant amount that a student is eligible to receive for a payment period in a clock-hour or non- term credit-hour program is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods for the program that are established at the beginning of the program based on the program length (as described earlier in this chapter). These scheduled payment periods do not change, regardless of a student9s rate of progression through a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program. This means that if a student completes additional weeks of instructional time or hours while completing the other measure of a payment period, the actual number of weeks or hours that the student completes before a disbursement can be made for the next payment period may differ from the number of weeks or hours in the scheduled payment period used to determine the student9s grant amount for the payment period. Although a student9s completion of additional weeks or hours in a payment period has no effect on the scheduled payment periods for purposes of determining Pell Grant and TEACH Grant payment amounts, an undergraduate student who accelerates in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year of a program. Specifically, if a student enrolled in a program that is greater than one academic year in length completes additional clock or credit hours prior to the final academic year of the program, this may result in a final period of study that contains fewer clock or credit hours than the number of hours in the program9s defined academic year. In this circumstance, the Direct Loan annual loan limit for an undergraduate student must be prorated (reduced). The principles described above are illustrated by the examples in Appendix A at the end of this chapter. For guidance on calculating Pell Grant and TEACH Grant awards for clock-hour and non-term credit-hour programs, see Volume 7. For information on Direct Loan annual loan limit proration and annual loan limit progression in clock-hour and non-term credit- hour programs, see Volume 8, Chapters 5 and 6. If your school is unable to determine when a student has successfully completed half of the credit or clock hours in a program, academic year, or remainder of a program, the student is considered to have begun the second payment period of the program, academic year, or remainder of a program at the later of the date (identified by your school) that the student has successfully completed: half of the academic coursework in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program; or half of the number of weeks of instructional time in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program.', '<2-hop>\n\nnon-term (includes clock-hour calendars), or subscription-based. In a standard term or nonstandard term academic calendar, a term is generally a period in which all classes are scheduled to begin and end within a set time frame, and academic progress is measured in credit hours. In a non-term academic calendar, classes do not begin and end within a set time frame, such as a term. Academic progress in a non-term program can be measured in either credit or clock hours. In some cases (as discussed below), a program with terms must be treated as a non-term program for Title IV purposes. A subscription-based academic calendar is used only by subscription-based programs. A subscription-based program is a term-based program in which the school charges a student for each term on a subscription basis with the expectation that the student will complete a specified number of credit hours (or the equivalent) during that term. However, classes in a subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term, as is the case in a term-based calendar that is not subscription-based. For more detail on subscription-based programs, see Volume 2, Chapter 2. A subscription-based academic calendar consists of ""subscription periods"" that are either standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms (for guidance on when terms are considered to be substantially equal in length, see <Payment periods for programs using standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms= later in this chapter). Substantially equal nonstandard terms may be of any length, but if they are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for purposes of monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6 for more information on BBAY 3). Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length are not permissible in a subscription-based academic calendar. The term ""subscription period"" is synonymous with ""term"" and ""payment period"" (payment periods are covered later in this chapter). Except for the fact that classes are not required to start and end within a term, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs. These requirements include: minimum and maximum term length restrictions for standard terms (see the discussion in the next section of this chapter); requirements for determining full-time enrollment (see Volume 1, Chapter 1); use of a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY), BBAY 1, BBAY 2, or BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6); and use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards (see Volume 7, Chapter 4). Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. Standard Terms: Semesters, Trimesters, and Quarters Semesters and trimesters contain between 14 and 21 weeks of instructional time. However, a summer term in a program using semesters or trimesters may contain fewer than 14 weeks. An academic calendar that uses semesters or trimesters traditionally has three terms, one each in the fall, spring, and summer, two of which comprise an academic year. For example, in a program using an SAY calendar, fall and spring would comprise an academic year. In a program using a']","The structure of non-term and subscription-based academic calendars significantly influences the calculation and disbursement of Pell Grant awards in clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs. Since these programs often do not align with traditional academic calendars, the determination of payment periods and the overall academic year is based on the specific structure of the program, such as total clock hours or instructional time, rather than standard semester or quarter dates.

In non-term programs, Pell Grants are paid in installments over the course of the academic year or program, with the payment periods defined according to the program's structure. The full-time Scheduled Award is used as the basis for the annual award, regardless of whether the student is enrolled part-time, unless the student is enrolled less than half-time. If a program's calendar does not match the school's academic calendar—such as having nonstandard terms or continuous enrollment—the timing of disbursements and the calculation of awards are adjusted accordingly.

For example, a program might define an academic year as containing 24 semester hours and 30 weeks of instructional time, but the school's academic calendar might consist of four 8-week nonstandard terms. This discrepancy affects how Pell Grant awards are calculated and disbursed, as the payment periods are determined by the program's structure rather than the school's calendar. Additionally, enrollment intensity and part-time status considerations are factored into the award calculation, especially if the student is attending less than half-time.

Overall, the nonstandard calendar structure requires careful alignment of payment periods and award calculations to ensure accurate disbursement of Pell Grants in these types of programs.","The structure of non-term and subscription-based academic calendars directly impacts the calculation and disbursement of Pell Grant awards in clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs. In non-term academic calendars, classes do not begin and end within a set timeframe, and academic progress can be measured in either credit or clock hours. For Pell Grant awards in these programs, the amount a student is eligible to receive for a payment period is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods established at the beginning of the program. These scheduled payment periods do not change, regardless of a student’s rate of progression. In subscription-based programs, which are a type of term-based program, Pell Grant awards are calculated using Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3, and the term 'subscription period' is synonymous with 'term' and 'payment period.' The rules for term-based programs also apply to subscription-based programs, including requirements for determining full-time enrollment and the use of specific academic year structures. Therefore, the academic calendar type determines both the method for calculating Pell Grant awards and the timing of disbursements under Title IV regulations.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

However, to receive a disbursement of Title IV aid for each subsequent subscription period in the program, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods in the program, excluding the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in the most recently attended subscription period. For more detailed guidance on the disbursement rules for subscription-based programs, including examples, refer to Appendix B at the end of this chapter. Multiple Disbursements Within a Payment Period The regulations governing the Title IV programs generally permit schools to pay Title IV funds at such times and in such installments within each payment period as will best meet students9 needs. This gives schools the ability to apportion the payment if doing so will be in the best interest of the student. For example, if a payment period is particularly long, a school might choose to pay in multiple installments to the extent program requirements permit to ensure that a student will have funds to pay rent later in the payment period. If a school chooses to schedule multiple Direct Loan disbursements within a single payment period, the disbursements must be substantially equal. Note also that if the loan period for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless the school qualifies for an exception to the multiple disbursement requirement.

   - For the third and subsequent subscription periods, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total hours for which they were enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods, excluding the hours for which the student was not enrolled.

2. Use of Subscription Periods and BBAY 3:
   - Subscription periods are considered equivalent to terms and payment periods, but classes are not required to start and end within a traditional term structure.
   - The program must use BBAY 3 for monitoring the Direct Loan annual loan limit progression if the nonstandard terms are not at least nine weeks in length. Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length are not permitted in a subscription-based calendar.

3. Multiple Disbursements Within a Payment Period:
   - Multiple disbursements within a payment period are allowed.
   - The timing of these disbursements is tied to the student's progress, especially after the initial two subscription periods.
   - Unlike standard term programs, where disbursements are often contingent on specific coursework completion within a term, subscription-based programs permit disbursements without initial coursework requirements, focusing instead on cumulative credit hour completion for subsequent disbursements.

In summary, subscription-based programs relax the initial coursework requirements for disbursements, emphasize cumulative credit hour completion for subsequent disbursements, and utilize BBAY 3 for monitoring loan limits when applicable. They also allow for multiple disbursements within a payment period, with disbursement timing closely linked to student progress rather than fixed term completion.","In subscription-based programs, as described in Volume 8, Chapter 6 and referenced in Volume 8, Chapter 3, the disbursement timing for Title IV aid differs from standard term or non-term academic calendars.
