In a standard term or nonstandard term academic calendar, a term is generally a period in which all classes are scheduled to begin and end within a set time frame, and academic progress is measured in credit hours. In a non-term academic calendar, classes do not begin and end within a set time frame, such as a term. Academic progress in a non-term program can be measured in either credit or clock hours. In some cases (as discussed below), a program with terms must be treated as a non-term program for Title IV purposes. A subscription-based academic calendar is used only by subscription-based programs. A subscription-based program is a term-based program in which the school charges a student for each term on a subscription basis with the expectation that the student will complete a specified number of credit hours (or the equivalent) during that term. However, classes in a subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term, as is the case in a term-based calendar that is not subscription-based. For more detail on subscription-based programs, see Volume 2, Chapter 2. A subscription-based academic calendar consists of ""subscription periods"" that are either standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms (for guidance on when terms are considered to be substantially equal in length, see <Payment periods for programs using standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms= later in this chapter). Substantially equal nonstandard terms may be of any length, but if they are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for purposes of monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6 for more information on BBAY 3). Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length are not permissible in a subscription-based academic calendar. The term ""subscription period"" is synonymous with ""term"" and ""payment period"" (payment periods are covered later in this chapter). Except for the fact that classes are not required to start and end within a term, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs. These requirements include: minimum and maximum term length restrictions for standard terms (see the discussion in the next section of this chapter); requirements for determining full-time enrollment (see Volume 1, Chapter 1); use of a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY), BBAY 1, BBAY 2, or BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6); and use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards (see Volume 7, Chapter 4). Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. Standard Terms: Semesters, Trimesters, and Quarters Semesters and trimesters contain between 14 and 21 weeks of instructional time. However, a summer term in a program using semesters or trimesters may contain fewer than 14 weeks. An academic calendar that uses semesters or trimesters traditionally has three terms, one each in the fall, spring, and summer, two of which comprise an academic year. For example, in a program using an SAY calendar, fall and spring would comprise an academic year. In a program using a']","The disbursement of Pell Grants is generally based on the academic year and the student's eligibility, rather than the specific structure of the academic calendar. Pell Grants are disbursed annually, with the total award amount depending on factors such as the student's financial need, enrollment status, and the maximum award for the award year. The disbursement process involves allocating funds to eligible students, typically in multiple payments throughout the academic year.

The structure of the academic calendar can influence federal student aid eligibility in the following ways:

- **Standard Term Calendar:** Programs with a traditional semester or quarter system, usually with at least 30 weeks of instruction per year, meet the federal requirement for aid eligibility based on the academic year.

- **Nonstandard Term Calendar:** Programs with shorter terms or non-traditional schedules may still qualify for federal aid if the total instructional weeks in the academic year meet the minimum requirement of 30 weeks.

- **Non-term or Self-paced Programs:** These programs often have flexible or overlapping terms. To qualify for federal aid, they must include at least 30 weeks of instruction within the academic year.

- **Subscription-based or Modular Programs:** These programs need to demonstrate that their academic year includes the required minimum of 30 weeks of instruction to be eligible for Pell Grant disbursement.

In summary, while the Pell Grant disbursement itself is tied to the academic year and student eligibility, the calendar structure affects whether a program qualifies for federal aid based on the requirement of at least 30 weeks of instruction per year.","The structure of an academic calendar—whether it is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based—affects how Pell Grant awards are calculated and disbursed. In subscription-based programs, which are term-based but do not require classes to start and end within a specific timeframe, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply. This includes the use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards. The type of academic calendar determines the applicable Pell Grant formula and the timing of aid disbursement under Title IV programs.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
"medicine program clinical work, it gotta be in standard term or not?",[],"['Inclusion of Clinical Work in a Standard Term Periods of medical and education program clinical work which is conducted outside the classroom may not be included in a standard term, unless all of the following apply: All students in the program must participate in the practicum or clinical experience, and they must be required to complete the practicum or clinical experience as a condition for applying for licensure or authorization to practice the occupation they intend to pursue; The school has little or no control over the length or starting and ending dates of the practicum or clinical experience. This may be due to constraints imposed by outside licensing bodies or the need to accommodate schedules of entities with which students are being placed (e.g., school districts or hospitals); and Credit hours associated with the practicum or clinical experience must be associated with the term in which most of the training occurs, even if the starting and ending dates do not exactly align with the term dates and/or overlap with another term. If the clinical work meets all the above criteria, terms which include such clinical work are not required to be considered nonstandard, nor are such programs required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. This flexibility is limited to required clinical periods associated with standard term programs in medicine (including, but not limited to, allopathic, osteopathic, nursing, veterinary, dentistry, pharmacy, and physical therapy), and student teaching required to obtain a state teaching certificate. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for additional guidance on certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets the criteria described above is included in a standard term. Nonstandard Terms Generally, nonstandard terms are terms that are not semesters, trimesters, or quarters. For example, a 5-week term or a 23-week term would be considered a nonstandard term because no standard term can be fewer than nine weeks or greater than 21 weeks in length. Like standard terms, nonstandard terms may be equal in length or may be of different lengths. If a program is offered in a combination of standard terms and nonstandard terms, the program is considered to be offered in nonstandard terms. Also, like standard terms, nonstandard terms may not overlap within a program. Even if a school calls its terms semesters, trimesters, or quarters, they are considered to be nonstandard terms if they do not comply with the policy on standard term length, as described earlier. For instance, a 22-week semester or an 8-week quarter must be treated as a nonstandard term, because a semester cannot contain more than 21 weeks and a quarter must include a minimum of nine weeks. Semesters, trimesters, or quarters are also considered to be nonstandard terms if academic progress is not measured in the manner normally associated with the type of term. For example, if a program is offered in 15-week semesters but measures academic progress in quarter credit hours, the semesters would be considered nonstandard terms.']",Could you please clarify your question a bit more? Are you asking whether clinical work in a medicine program needs to be documented or described using standard medical terminology? Or are you referring to the requirements for clinical work in a specific medicine program? Providing more details will help me give you a more accurate answer.,"If the clinical work in a medicine program meets all the criteria listed—like all students must do it, it's required for licensure, the school don't control the dates, and the credit hours go with the term where most training happens—then terms with that clinical work don't gotta be considered nonstandard, even if the clinical work overlaps another term.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer

"so like if a student gettin a TEACH Grant in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program, and they finish more weeks or hours than scheduled in a payment period, does that change how much TEACH Grant they get or when they get the next disbursement, or what happen if they go faster than normal?",[],"['both the credit or clock hours and the weeks of instructional time in a payment period before receiving a disbursement of Pell Grant, FSEOG, TEACH Grant or Direct Loan funds for the next payment period. For the Direct Loan Program only, this same requirement applies to students who are enrolled in programs with nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length. Effect of Accelerated Progression on Disbursement Timing in a Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Program The Pell Grant or TEACH Grant amount that a student is eligible to receive for a payment period in a clock-hour or non- term credit-hour program is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods for the program that are established at the beginning of the program based on the program length (as described earlier in this chapter). These scheduled payment periods do not change, regardless of a student9s rate of progression through a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program. This means that if a student completes additional weeks of instructional time or hours while completing the other measure of a payment period, the actual number of weeks or hours that the student completes before a disbursement can be made for the next payment period may differ from the number of weeks or hours in the scheduled payment period used to determine the student9s grant amount for the payment period. Although a student9s completion of additional weeks or hours in a payment period has no effect on the scheduled payment periods for purposes of determining Pell Grant and TEACH Grant payment amounts, an undergraduate student who accelerates in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year of a program. Specifically, if a student enrolled in a program that is greater than one academic year in length completes additional clock or credit hours prior to the final academic year of the program, this may result in a final period of study that contains fewer clock or credit hours than the number of hours in the program9s defined academic year. In this circumstance, the Direct Loan annual loan limit for an undergraduate student must be prorated (reduced). The principles described above are illustrated by the examples in Appendix A at the end of this chapter. For guidance on calculating Pell Grant and TEACH Grant awards for clock-hour and non-term credit-hour programs, see Volume 7. For information on Direct Loan annual loan limit proration and annual loan limit progression in clock-hour and non-term credit- hour programs, see Volume 8, Chapters 5 and 6. If your school is unable to determine when a student has successfully completed half of the credit or clock hours in a program, academic year, or remainder of a program, the student is considered to have begun the second payment period of the program, academic year, or remainder of a program at the later of the date (identified by your school) that the student has successfully completed: half of the academic coursework in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program; or half of the number of weeks of instructional time in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program.']","Exceeding the scheduled weeks or hours in a payment period does not change the scheduled payment periods for Pell Grant and TEACH Grant disbursements. However, for students in clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs, completing additional hours or weeks earlier than scheduled may result in a final period of study that contains fewer hours than originally planned. 

This means that while the scheduled payment periods remain the same, the actual number of weeks or hours completed before a disbursement can be made might differ from the original schedule. If a student accelerates their pace, they might receive disbursements earlier or in a different manner, but the overall payment schedule does not automatically change based on faster progress.","if a student gettin a TEACH Grant in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program finishes more weeks or hours than scheduled in a payment period, it don’t change the scheduled payment periods used to figure out the TEACH Grant amount for that period. the scheduled payment periods stay the same no matter how fast the student goes, so the grant amount don’t change. but the actual number of weeks or hours the student completes before gettin the next disbursement might be different from the scheduled amount. so, goin faster don’t affect the TEACH Grant payment amount, just when the next disbursement can happen.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer

For example, if a payment period is particularly long, a school might choose to pay in multiple installments to the extent program requirements permit to ensure that a student will have funds to pay rent later in the payment period. If a school chooses to schedule multiple Direct Loan disbursements within a single payment period, the disbursements must be substantially equal. Note also that if the loan period for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless the school qualifies for an exception to the multiple disbursement requirement.

This means students can receive disbursements regardless of their coursework completion status.

In contrast, subscription-based programs have specific disbursement timing rules. For the first two subscription periods (terms), a school can disburse Title IV funds up to 10 days before the start of each period, with no coursework completion requirement. However, starting with the third subscription period and for each subsequent period, a student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total hours for which they were enrolled in all previous subscription periods (excluding nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length). Additionally, a disbursement for the third and subsequent periods can only be made if the student has completed the required coursework hours; otherwise, the school must wait until the student meets this requirement before disbursing funds.

In summary:
- **Clock-hour/non-term programs:** No coursework completion requirement before disbursement.
- **Subscription-based programs:** No coursework requirement for the first two periods; from the third period onward, students must have completed the cumulative credit hours from previous periods before receiving subsequent disbursements.","In clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs, students must complete both the required credit or clock hours and the weeks of instructional time in a payment period before receiving a disbursement of Pell Grant, FSEOG, TEACH Grant, or Direct Loan funds for the next payment period.

For example, a 5-week term or a 23-week term would be considered a nonstandard term because no standard term can be fewer than nine weeks or greater than 21 weeks in length. Like standard terms, nonstandard terms may be equal in length or may be of different lengths. If a program is offered in a combination of standard terms and nonstandard terms, the program is considered to be offered in nonstandard terms. Also, like standard terms, nonstandard terms may not overlap within a program. Even if a school calls its terms semesters, trimesters, or quarters, they are considered to be nonstandard terms if they do not comply with the policy on standard term length, as described earlier. For instance, a 22-week semester or an 8-week quarter must be treated as a nonstandard term, because a semester cannot contain more than 21 weeks and a quarter must include a minimum of nine weeks. Semesters, trimesters, or quarters are also considered to be nonstandard terms if academic progress is not measured in the manner normally associated with the type of term. For example, if a program is offered in 15-week semesters but measures academic progress in quarter credit hours, the semesters would be considered nonstandard terms.', '<2-hop>\n\nNon-Term Characteristics A program that measures progress in clock hours is always treated as a non-term program. Except for subscription-based programs, a program that measures progress in credit-hours is considered to have a non- term calendar if it has: Courses that do not begin and end within a set period of time such as a term; Courses that overlap terms; Self-paced and independent study courses that overlap terms; or Sequential courses that do not begin and end within a term. Payment Periods The payment period is applicable to all Title IV programs except the Federal Work-Study (FWS) Program. For example, Title IV program disbursements (except FWS payments) must be made on a payment period basis, as discussed in detail']","A practicum or clinical experience required for licensure in a medical or education program can be included in a standard term if the following conditions are met:

1. All students in the program must participate in the practicum or clinical experience, and it must be a requirement for applying for licensure or authorization to practice the occupation they intend to pursue.
2. The school has little or no control over the length or start and end dates of the practicum or clinical experience, often due to external licensing bodies or scheduling constraints with placement entities.
3. The credit hours associated with the practicum or clinical experience must be linked to the term in which most of the training occurs, even if the actual dates overlap with another term or do not align exactly with the term dates.

This differs from non-term programs, which are characterized by periods of clinical work that are not included within a standard term unless they meet the above criteria. Non-term programs typically do not have clinical work embedded within a standard term unless specific conditions are satisfied, and they are generally considered separate from standard term programs.","A practicum or clinical experience required for licensure in a medical or education program can be included in a standard term if all students must participate in it as a condition for licensure, the school has little or no control over its length or dates (often due to external licensing bodies or placement schedules), and the credit hours are associated with the term in which most training occurs, even if the dates do not align exactly with the term or overlap another term. If these criteria are met, the program is not required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. In contrast, non-term programs are defined by characteristics such as measuring progress in clock hours, having courses that do not begin and end within a set term, courses that overlap terms, or self-paced and independent study courses. Thus, while required clinical experiences can be included in standard terms under specific conditions, programs with the non-term characteristics described must be treated as non-term programs.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer

For the Direct Loan Program only, this same requirement applies to students who are enrolled in programs with nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length. Effect of Accelerated Progression on Disbursement Timing in a Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Program The Pell Grant or TEACH Grant amount that a student is eligible to receive for a payment period in a clock-hour or non- term credit-hour program is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods for the program that are established at the beginning of the program based on the program length (as described earlier in this chapter). These scheduled payment periods do not change, regardless of a student9s rate of progression through a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program. This means that if a student completes additional weeks of instructional time or hours while completing the other measure of a payment period, the actual number of weeks or hours that the student completes before a disbursement can be made for the next payment period may differ from the number of weeks or hours in the scheduled payment period used to determine the student9s grant amount for the payment period. Although a student9s completion of additional weeks or hours in a payment period has no effect on the scheduled payment periods for purposes of determining Pell Grant and TEACH Grant payment amounts, an undergraduate student who accelerates in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year of a program. Specifically, if a student enrolled in a program that is greater than one academic year in length completes additional clock or credit hours prior to the final academic year of the program, this may result in a final period of study that contains fewer clock or credit hours than the number of hours in the program9s defined academic year. In this circumstance, the Direct Loan annual loan limit for an undergraduate student must be prorated (reduced). The principles described above are illustrated by the examples in Appendix A at the end of this chapter. For guidance on calculating Pell Grant and TEACH Grant awards for clock-hour and non-term credit-hour programs, see Volume 7. For information on Direct Loan annual loan limit proration and annual loan limit progression in clock-hour and non-term credit- hour programs, see Volume 8, Chapters 5 and 6. If your school is unable to determine when a student has successfully completed half of the credit or clock hours in a program, academic year, or remainder of a program, the student is considered to have begun the second payment period of the program, academic year, or remainder of a program at the later of the date (identified by your school) that the student has successfully completed: half of the academic coursework in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program; or half of the number of weeks of instructional time in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program.', '<2-hop>\n\nDisbursement Timing in Subscription-Based Programs For the first two subscription periods (terms) that a student attends in a subscription-based program, there is no requirement for the student to have completed a certain amount of coursework before receiving a disbursement of Title IV funds (the same as in any other term-based program using credit hours).

This gives schools the ability to apportion the payment if doing so will be in the best interest of the student. For example, if a payment period is particularly long, a school might choose to pay in multiple installments to the extent program requirements permit to ensure that a student will have funds to pay rent later in the payment period. If a school chooses to schedule multiple Direct Loan disbursements within a single payment period, the disbursements must be substantially equal. Note also that if the loan period for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless the school qualifies for an exception to the multiple disbursement requirement. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more']","The disbursement timing requirements for federal student aid differ between program types as follows:

1. **Clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs**: There is no requirement for students to have completed a specific amount of coursework or credit hours before receiving subsequent disbursements. Schools can disburse funds without waiting for coursework completion within the payment period.

2. **Subscription-based programs**: 
   - For the first two subscription periods, schools can disburse funds up to 10 days before the period begins, regardless of coursework completion.
   - Starting with the third subscription period, a disbursement can only be made early if the student has completed the required credit hours for that period. If the student has not met the coursework requirement, the school must wait until the student completes the necessary credit hours before disbursing funds.

Regarding scheduling multiple disbursements within a payment period, schools have flexibility to make multiple disbursements. However, for subscription-based programs, the timing of these disbursements depends on the student's completion of the required coursework or credit hours for each period.","In clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs, students must complete both the required credit or clock hours and the weeks of instructional time in a payment period before they can receive a disbursement of Pell Grant, FSEOG, TEACH Grant, or Direct Loan funds for the next payment period. The scheduled payment periods are established at the beginning of the program and do not change based on a student's rate of progression. If a student accelerates and completes additional weeks or hours, this does not affect the scheduled payment periods for Pell Grant and TEACH Grant amounts, but may result in reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year if the last period contains fewer hours than the defined academic year, requiring proration of the loan limit.

In subscription-based programs, for the first two subscription periods, there is no requirement for the student to complete a certain amount of coursework before receiving a disbursement of Title IV funds. However, for each subsequent subscription period, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total number of hours for which they were enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods, excluding the most recently attended period.

Additionally, schools have flexibility in scheduling multiple disbursements within a payment period for Title IV programs. They may pay funds in such times and installments as best meet students’ needs, such as splitting payments in longer periods to help students manage expenses.

In a standard term or nonstandard term academic calendar, a term is generally a period in which all classes are scheduled to begin and end within a set time frame, and academic progress is measured in credit hours. In a non-term academic calendar, classes do not begin and end within a set time frame, such as a term. Academic progress in a non-term program can be measured in either credit or clock hours. In some cases (as discussed below), a program with terms must be treated as a non-term program for Title IV purposes. A subscription-based academic calendar is used only by subscription-based programs. A subscription-based program is a term-based program in which the school charges a student for each term on a subscription basis with the expectation that the student will complete a specified number of credit hours (or the equivalent) during that term. However, classes in a subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term, as is the case in a term-based calendar that is not subscription-based. For more detail on subscription-based programs, see Volume 2, Chapter 2. A subscription-based academic calendar consists of ""subscription periods"" that are either standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms (for guidance on when terms are considered to be substantially equal in length, see <Payment periods for programs using standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms= later in this chapter). Substantially equal nonstandard terms may be of any length, but if they are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for purposes of monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6 for more information on BBAY 3). Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length are not permissible in a subscription-based academic calendar. The term ""subscription period"" is synonymous with ""term"" and ""payment period"" (payment periods are covered later in this chapter). Except for the fact that classes are not required to start and end within a term, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs. These requirements include: minimum and maximum term length restrictions for standard terms (see the discussion in the next section of this chapter); requirements for determining full-time enrollment (see Volume 1, Chapter 1); use of a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY), BBAY 1, BBAY 2, or BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6); and use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards (see Volume 7, Chapter 4). Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. Standard Terms: Semesters, Trimesters, and Quarters Semesters and trimesters contain between 14 and 21 weeks of instructional time. However, a summer term in a program using semesters or trimesters may contain fewer than 14 weeks. An academic calendar that uses semesters or trimesters traditionally has three terms, one each in the fall, spring, and summer, two of which comprise an academic year. For example, in a program using an SAY calendar, fall and spring would comprise an academic year. In a program using a']","The structure of non-term and subscription-based academic calendars significantly influences the calculation and disbursement of Pell Grant awards in clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs. These programs often do not align with traditional academic calendars, which impacts how payment periods are determined and how the academic year is defined.

Specifically, the academic year for such programs may be based on total instructional time or hours rather than standard semester or quarter dates. This means that the payment periods, which dictate when Pell funds are disbursed and in what amounts, are established according to the specific structure of the program, such as clock hours or non-standard terms.

In non-term programs, the Pell award is generally not reduced for part-time enrollment unless the student is enrolled less than half-time, and the Cost of Attendance (COA) must be adjusted accordingly. The full-time Scheduled Award remains the basis for the annual award, regardless of actual attendance.

Furthermore, if a program's calendar does not match the school's academic calendar—such as having a different number of instructional weeks or hours—the calculation of Pell Grant awards and the timing of disbursements are adjusted to reflect these differences. This ensures that the disbursement aligns with the student's enrollment and instructional time, maintaining the integrity of the award process.

In summary, the non-standard structure of these calendars requires tailored calculation methods for Pell Grant awards, focusing on instructional hours and program-specific timelines rather than traditional academic periods.","The structure of non-term and subscription-based academic calendars directly impacts the calculation and disbursement of Pell Grant awards in clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs. In non-term academic calendars, classes do not begin and end within a set timeframe, and academic progress can be measured in either credit or clock hours. For Pell Grant awards in these programs, the amount a student is eligible to receive for a payment period is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods established at the beginning of the program. These scheduled payment periods do not change, regardless of a student’s rate of progression. In subscription-based programs, which are a type of term-based program, Pell Grant awards are calculated using Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3, and the term 'subscription period' is synonymous with 'term' and 'payment period.' The rules for term-based programs also apply to subscription-based programs, including requirements for determining full-time enrollment and the use of specific academic year structures.

In a non-term academic calendar, classes do not begin and end within a set time frame, such as a term. Academic progress in a non-term program can be measured in either credit or clock hours. In some cases (as discussed below), a program with terms must be treated as a non-term program for Title IV purposes. A subscription-based academic calendar is used only by subscription-based programs. A subscription-based program is a term-based program in which the school charges a student for each term on a subscription basis with the expectation that the student will complete a specified number of credit hours (or the equivalent) during that term. However, classes in a subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term, as is the case in a term-based calendar that is not subscription-based. For more detail on subscription-based programs, see Volume 2, Chapter 2. A subscription-based academic calendar consists of ""subscription periods"" that are either standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms (for guidance on when terms are considered to be substantially equal in length, see <Payment periods for programs using standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms= later in this chapter). Substantially equal nonstandard terms may be of any length, but if they are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for purposes of monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6 for more information on BBAY 3). Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length are not permissible in a subscription-based academic calendar. The term ""subscription period"" is synonymous with ""term"" and ""payment period"" (payment periods are covered later in this chapter). Except for the fact that classes are not required to start and end within a term, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs. These requirements include: minimum and maximum term length restrictions for standard terms (see the discussion in the next section of this chapter); requirements for determining full-time enrollment (see Volume 1, Chapter 1); use of a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY), BBAY 1, BBAY 2, or BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6); and use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards (see Volume 7, Chapter 4). Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. Standard Terms: Semesters, Trimesters, and Quarters Semesters and trimesters contain between 14 and 21 weeks of instructional time. However, a summer term in a program using semesters or trimesters may contain fewer than 14 weeks. An academic calendar that uses semesters or trimesters traditionally has three terms, one each in the fall, spring, and summer, two of which comprise an academic year. For example, in a program using an SAY calendar, fall and spring would comprise an academic year. In a program using a']","In subscription-based programs, the requirements for disbursement timing and academic progress differ from those in standard term or non-term academic calendars in several ways:

1. Disbursement Timing:
   - For the first two subscription periods (terms), students are not required to have completed a specific amount of coursework before receiving Title IV funds.
   - For the third and subsequent subscription periods, students must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total hours for which they were enrolled in all previous subscription periods, excluding the hours for which the student was not enrolled.

2. Use of Subscription Periods and BBAY 3:
   - Subscription periods are considered equivalent to terms and payment periods, but classes are not required to start and end within a single term.
   - The program must use BBAY 3 for monitoring the student's progress toward the annual loan limit if the subscription periods are not at least nine weeks in length. This is similar to requirements in standard programs, but the use of BBAY 3 is specifically mandated for nonstandard, non-subscription programs that are not substantially equal in length.

3. Multiple Disbursements Within a Payment Period:
   - Multiple disbursements can occur within a single payment period in subscription-based programs, but the timing and eligibility depend on the student’s completion of credit hours as described above.
   - Unlike standard programs, where disbursements are often tied to specific points in a term or semester, subscription-based programs allow for more flexible disbursement timing based on the student’s progress through the subscription periods.

In summary, subscription-based programs relax the coursework completion requirement for initial disbursements but impose a cumulative credit hour completion requirement for subsequent disbursements, with specific monitoring via BBAY 3 if the subscription periods are shorter than nine weeks. Multiple disbursements within a payment period are permitted but are contingent upon the student’s progress, differing from the more rigid timing in standard term or non-term calendars.","In subscription-based programs, as described in Volume 8, Chapter 6 and referenced in Volume 8, Chapter 3, the disbursement timing for Title IV aid differs from standard term or non-term academic calendars. For the first two subscription periods, students are not required to complete a certain amount of coursework before receiving Title IV funds, similar to other term-based programs using credit hours. However, for subsequent subscription periods, students must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods, excluding the most recent one, to receive further disbursements. Subscription-based programs use 'subscription periods,' which are synonymous with 'terms' or 'payment periods,' and these can be standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms. If nonstandard terms are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression. Additionally, schools may choose to make multiple disbursements within a payment period, but if they do so for Direct Loans, the disbursements must be substantially equal, and if the loan period is a single payment period, at least two installments are required unless an exception applies. These requirements ensure that aid is awarded and disbursed in accordance with the unique structure of subscription-based programs, as opposed to the more rigid timing and progress requirements in standard term or non-term calendars.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
