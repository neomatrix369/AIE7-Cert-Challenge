In a standard term or nonstandard term academic calendar, a term is generally a period in which all classes are scheduled to begin and end within a set time frame, and academic progress is measured in credit hours. In a non-term academic calendar, classes do not begin and end within a set time frame, such as a term. Academic progress in a non-term program can be measured in either credit or clock hours. In some cases (as discussed below), a program with terms must be treated as a non-term program for Title IV purposes. A subscription-based academic calendar is used only by subscription-based programs. A subscription-based program is a term-based program in which the school charges a student for each term on a subscription basis with the expectation that the student will complete a specified number of credit hours (or the equivalent) during that term. However, classes in a subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term, as is the case in a term-based calendar that is not subscription-based. For more detail on subscription-based programs, see Volume 2, Chapter 2. A subscription-based academic calendar consists of ""subscription periods"" that are either standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms (for guidance on when terms are considered to be substantially equal in length, see <Payment periods for programs using standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms= later in this chapter). Substantially equal nonstandard terms may be of any length, but if they are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for purposes of monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6 for more information on BBAY 3). Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length are not permissible in a subscription-based academic calendar. The term ""subscription period"" is synonymous with ""term"" and ""payment period"" (payment periods are covered later in this chapter). Except for the fact that classes are not required to start and end within a term, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs. These requirements include: minimum and maximum term length restrictions for standard terms (see the discussion in the next section of this chapter); requirements for determining full-time enrollment (see Volume 1, Chapter 1); use of a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY), BBAY 1, BBAY 2, or BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6); and use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards (see Volume 7, Chapter 4). Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. Standard Terms: Semesters, Trimesters, and Quarters Semesters and trimesters contain between 14 and 21 weeks of instructional time. However, a summer term in a program using semesters or trimesters may contain fewer than 14 weeks. An academic calendar that uses semesters or trimesters traditionally has three terms, one each in the fall, spring, and summer, two of which comprise an academic year. For example, in a program using an SAY calendar, fall and spring would comprise an academic year. In a program using a']","The Pell Grant award for students enrolled in subscription-based academic calendars is calculated using Pell Grant Formula 4, which is specifically designed for non-term programs. This formula takes into account the student's enrollment status, credit hours, and the length of the academic year. Additionally, the Year-round Pell provision allows students to receive extra funding for summer enrollment. The maximum Pell Grant award for the 2024-25 award year is $7,395.

This may be due to constraints imposed by outside licensing bodies or the need to accommodate schedules of entities with which students are being placed (e.g., school districts or hospitals); and Credit hours associated with the practicum or clinical experience must be associated with the term in which most of the training occurs, even if the starting and ending dates do not exactly align with the term dates and/or overlap with another term. If the clinical work meets all the above criteria, terms which include such clinical work are not required to be considered nonstandard, nor are such programs required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. This flexibility is limited to required clinical periods associated with standard term programs in medicine (including, but not limited to, allopathic, osteopathic, nursing, veterinary, dentistry, pharmacy, and physical therapy), and student teaching required to obtain a state teaching certificate. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for additional guidance on certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets the criteria described above is included in a standard term. Nonstandard Terms Generally, nonstandard terms are terms that are not semesters, trimesters, or quarters. For example, a 5-week term or a 23-week term would be considered a nonstandard term because no standard term can be fewer than nine weeks or greater than 21 weeks in length. Like standard terms, nonstandard terms may be equal in length or may be of different lengths. If a program is offered in a combination of standard terms and nonstandard terms, the program is considered to be offered in nonstandard terms. Also, like standard terms, nonstandard terms may not overlap within a program. Even if a school calls its terms semesters, trimesters, or quarters, they are considered to be nonstandard terms if they do not comply with the policy on standard term length, as described earlier. For instance, a 22-week semester or an 8-week quarter must be treated as a nonstandard term, because a semester cannot contain more than 21 weeks and a quarter must include a minimum of nine weeks. Semesters, trimesters, or quarters are also considered to be nonstandard terms if academic progress is not measured in the manner normally associated with the type of term. For example, if a program is offered in 15-week semesters but measures academic progress in quarter credit hours, the semesters would be considered nonstandard terms.']","Veterinary clinical experiences are not included in standard term periods for financial aid purposes.

However, to receive a disbursement of Title IV aid for each subsequent subscription period in the program, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods in the program, excluding the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in the most recently attended subscription period. For more detailed guidance on the disbursement rules for subscription-based programs, including examples, refer to Appendix B at the end of this chapter. Multiple Disbursements Within a Payment Period The regulations governing the Title IV programs generally permit schools to pay Title IV funds at such times and in such installments within each payment period as will best meet students9 needs. This gives schools the ability to apportion the payment if doing so will be in the best interest of the student. For example, if a payment period is particularly long, a school might choose to pay in multiple installments to the extent program requirements permit to ensure that a student will have funds to pay rent later in the payment period. If a school chooses to schedule multiple Direct Loan disbursements within a single payment period, the disbursements must be substantially equal. Note also that if the loan period for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless the school qualifies for an exception to the multiple disbursement requirement. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more']","The disbursement timing rules for federal student aid differ between clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs and subscription-based programs as follows:

1. Clock-hour or Non-term Credit-hour Programs:
- These programs must use non-term academic calendars for Title IV aid.
- Pell Grants and other federal aid are awarded based on credit/clock hours and weeks of instruction.
- A credit-hour program's academic year must include at least 30 weeks of instruction to be eligible for federal student aid.
- Disbursements are aligned with the academic calendar, and students become eligible for disbursement based on their enrollment in eligible payment periods within the academic year.

2. Subscription-based Programs:
- Disbursements follow specific timing rules based on the program and academic term.
- For example, Direct Unsubsidized Loans are typically disbursed in monthly installments.
- The timing of the next disbursement depends on the student's enrollment status and the disbursement schedule set by the institution and federal regulations.
- Students generally become eligible for subsequent disbursements after completing the required attendance or academic progress criteria for each disbursement period.

In summary, clock-hour and non-term programs are tied to academic calendar weeks and payment periods, while subscription-based programs often disburse funds in regular intervals such as monthly, with eligibility for each disbursement contingent upon meeting specific academic or attendance requirements.","In clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs, students must complete both the required credit or clock hours and the weeks of instructional time in a payment period before they can receive a disbursement of Pell Grant, FSEOG, TEACH Grant, or Direct Loan funds for the next payment period.

Based on my knowledge, generally, federal student aid disbursement timing is aligned with the academic calendar or term schedule set by the institution. For clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs, disbursements are typically made at the start of each term or payment period, following the institution's schedule. 

For subscription-based programs, which are often continuous or non-term in nature, disbursement timing can vary more significantly. These programs may disburse funds more frequently, such as monthly or upon completion of certain milestones, depending on the institution's policies and the specific federal aid rules applicable to such programs.

To get precise and detailed information, I recommend consulting your school's financial aid office or reviewing the specific federal regulations that apply to your program type. Would you like me to look for more detailed or specific guidance?","In clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs, students must complete both the required credit or clock hours and weeks of instructional time in a payment period before receiving a disbursement of Pell Grant, FSEOG, TEACH Grant, or Direct Loan funds for the next payment period.

Effect of Accelerated Progression on Disbursement Timing in a Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Program The Pell Grant or TEACH Grant amount that a student is eligible to receive for a payment period in a clock-hour or non- term credit-hour program is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods for the program that are established at the beginning of the program based on the program length (as described earlier in this chapter).

Although a student9s completion of additional weeks or hours in a payment period has no effect on the scheduled payment periods for purposes of determining Pell Grant and TEACH Grant payment amounts, an undergraduate student who accelerates in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year of a program.

For standard clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs, disbursements are typically aligned with the academic term start date, and students usually need to meet certain eligibility criteria, such as maintaining satisfactory academic progress, before receiving subsequent disbursements. The initial disbursement often occurs shortly after the student completes the necessary financial aid application process and meets the school's eligibility requirements.

In contrast, subscription-based programs, which may involve ongoing or continuous enrollment models, tend to have disbursements that start at a specific date (e.g., July 1, 2025) and continue until a set period (e.g., June 30, 2026). For these programs, students generally need to meet specific criteria at the start of each disbursement period, such as being enrolled and making satisfactory academic progress, to receive subsequent disbursements. The process may involve periodic reviews or certifications to ensure ongoing eligibility.

For clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs, disbursements are typically contingent upon the student completing a certain portion of the program, such as half of the required clock hours or credit hours. Eligibility for federal aid in these programs often requires students to have completed a minimum number of hours—such as six credit hours or 225 clock hours. Disbursement processes are aligned with these milestones, ensuring funds are released only after specific progress is demonstrated.

In contrast, subscription-based programs tend to have more flexible disbursement timing, often based on ongoing enrollment or periodic payments rather than fixed academic milestones. Eligibility requirements may be less tied to specific hours completed and more focused on continuous enrollment or other criteria set by the institution or program.

These distinctions are reflected in the federal guidelines and practices, where clock-hour and non-term programs follow a structured disbursement schedule based on program progress, while subscription-based programs may operate on a more flexible, ongoing basis.","The examples in Appendix A illustrate the principles of disbursement timing and eligibility for Pell Grant, TEACH Grant, and Direct Loan funds in clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs, including how accelerated progression can affect Direct Loan annual loan limit proration in the final academic year.

However, to receive a disbursement of Title IV aid for each subsequent subscription period in the program, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods in the program, excluding the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in the most recently attended subscription period. For more detailed guidance on the disbursement rules for subscription-based programs, including examples, refer to Appendix B at the end of this chapter. Multiple Disbursements Within a Payment Period The regulations governing the Title IV programs generally permit schools to pay Title IV funds at such times and in such installments within each payment period as will best meet students9 needs. This gives schools the ability to apportion the payment if doing so will be in the best interest of the student. For example, if a payment period is particularly long, a school might choose to pay in multiple installments to the extent program requirements permit to ensure that a student will have funds to pay rent later in the payment period. If a school chooses to schedule multiple Direct Loan disbursements within a single payment period, the disbursements must be substantially equal. Note also that if the loan period for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless the school qualifies for an exception to the multiple disbursement requirement. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more', '<2-hop>\n\nInclusion of Clinical Work in a Standard Term Periods of medical and education program clinical work which is conducted outside the classroom may not be included in a standard term, unless all of the following apply: All students in the program must participate in the practicum or clinical experience, and they must be required to complete the practicum or clinical experience as a condition for applying for licensure or authorization to practice the occupation they intend to pursue; The school has little or no control over the length or starting and ending dates of the practicum or clinical experience. This may be due to constraints imposed by outside licensing bodies or the need to accommodate schedules of entities with which students are being placed (e.g., school districts or hospitals); and Credit hours associated with the practicum or clinical experience must be associated with the term in which most of the training occurs, even if the starting and ending dates do not exactly align with the term dates and/or overlap with another term. If the clinical work meets all the above criteria, terms which include such clinical work are not required to be considered nonstandard, nor are such programs required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. This flexibility is limited to required clinical periods associated with standard term programs in medicine (including, but not limited to, allopathic, osteopathic, nursing, veterinary, dentistry, pharmacy, and physical therapy), and student teaching required to obtain a state teaching certificate. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for additional guidance on certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets the criteria described above is included in a standard term. Nonstandard Terms Generally, nonstandard terms are terms that are not semesters, trimesters, or quarters. For example, a 5-week term or a 23-week term would be considered a nonstandard term because no standard term can be fewer than nine weeks or greater than 21 weeks in length. Like standard terms, nonstandard terms may be equal in length or may be of different lengths. If a program is offered in a combination of standard terms and nonstandard terms, the program is considered to be offered in nonstandard terms. Also, like standard terms, nonstandard terms may not overlap within a program. Even if a school calls its terms semesters, trimesters, or quarters, they are considered to be nonstandard terms if they do not comply with the policy on standard term length, as described earlier. For instance, a 22-week semester or an 8-week quarter must be treated as a nonstandard term, because a semester cannot contain more than 21 weeks and a quarter must include a minimum of nine weeks. Semesters, trimesters, or quarters are also considered to be nonstandard terms if academic progress is not measured in the manner normally associated with the type of term. For example, if a program is offered in 15-week semesters but measures academic progress in quarter credit hours, the semesters would be considered nonstandard terms.']","The disbursement timing rules for Title IV funds in subscription-based programs specify that funds are disbursed monthly. Typically, 75% of cases are resolved within 50 days, and 90% within 90 days. Contractors involved in disbursement must coordinate any system changes five business days in advance, with emergency changes requiring immediate notification.

Regarding Volume 8, Chapter 3, it provides guidance for clinical work related to the operations of Next Gen BPO providers. It emphasizes the importance of responding to client inquiries, processing student aid tasks using standardized methods, and providing contact center support. The chapter also highlights the need for training, compliance with FSA guidelines, and the process for suggesting improvements and managing new work assignments.","For the first two subscription periods in a subscription-based program, students do not need to complete a certain amount of coursework before receiving Title IV disbursements. For later periods, students must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to all previously attended periods, excluding the most recent one.

In a standard term or nonstandard term academic calendar, a term is generally a period in which all classes are scheduled to begin and end within a set time frame, and academic progress is measured in credit hours. In a non-term academic calendar, classes do not begin and end within a set time frame, such as a term. Academic progress in a non-term program can be measured in either credit or clock hours. In some cases (as discussed below), a program with terms must be treated as a non-term program for Title IV purposes. A subscription-based academic calendar is used only by subscription-based programs. A subscription-based program is a term-based program in which the school charges a student for each term on a subscription basis with the expectation that the student will complete a specified number of credit hours (or the equivalent) during that term. However, classes in a subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term, as is the case in a term-based calendar that is not subscription-based. For more detail on subscription-based programs, see Volume 2, Chapter 2. A subscription-based academic calendar consists of ""subscription periods"" that are either standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms (for guidance on when terms are considered to be substantially equal in length, see <Payment periods for programs using standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms= later in this chapter). Substantially equal nonstandard terms may be of any length, but if they are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for purposes of monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6 for more information on BBAY 3). Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length are not permissible in a subscription-based academic calendar. The term ""subscription period"" is synonymous with ""term"" and ""payment period"" (payment periods are covered later in this chapter).

Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. Standard Terms: Semesters, Trimesters, and Quarters Semesters and trimesters contain between 14 and 21 weeks of instructional time. However, a summer term in a program using semesters or trimesters may contain fewer than 14 weeks. An academic calendar that uses semesters or trimesters traditionally has three terms, one each in the fall, spring, and summer, two of which comprise an academic year. For example, in a program using an SAY calendar, fall and spring would comprise an academic year.

It explains that nonstandard terms can vary in length but must meet certain criteria, especially for subscription-based programs. Specifically, substantially equal nonstandard terms must be at least nine weeks long and are monitored using BBAY 3 for loan limit progression. Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal are not permitted in subscription-based calendars. The chapter also clarifies that subscription periods are equivalent to terms or payment periods, and programs using subscription-based calendars are subject to rules similar to standard term programs, including minimum and maximum term lengths, full-time enrollment requirements, and the use of specific BBAYs for loan monitoring.

Volume 8, Chapter 3 provides guidance on exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work is included in a standard term. It covers specific rules and considerations for clinical work programs, especially in health-related fields such as allopathic, osteopathic, nursing, veterinary, dentistry, pharmacy, and physical therapy, including student teaching required for certification. It emphasizes that certain clinical work meeting specific criteria can influence loan periods and disbursement timing, with additional guidance for programs that include clinical components within standard terms.","volume 8 chapter 6 is mentioned as giving more information on BBAY 3, which is used for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression in subscription-based programs with nonstandard terms that are not at least nine weeks in length. volume 8 chapter 3 is referenced for additional guidance on exceptions to normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets certain criteria is included in a standard term. both chapters provide details on how nonstandard terms affect Direct Loan rules, with chapter 6 focusing on subscription-based programs and BBAY 3, and chapter 3 addressing exceptions for clinical work in standard term programs.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer,"[None, 'ask_contextual_compression_llm_tool']",3

For the Direct Loan Program only, this same requirement applies to students who are enrolled in programs with nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length. Effect of Accelerated Progression on Disbursement Timing in a Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Program The Pell Grant or TEACH Grant amount that a student is eligible to receive for a payment period in a clock-hour or non- term credit-hour program is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods for the program that are established at the beginning of the program based on the program length (as described earlier in this chapter). These scheduled payment periods do not change, regardless of a student9s rate of progression through a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program. This means that if a student completes additional weeks of instructional time or hours while completing the other measure of a payment period, the actual number of weeks or hours that the student completes before a disbursement can be made for the next payment period may differ from the number of weeks or hours in the scheduled payment period used to determine the student9s grant amount for the payment period. Although a student9s completion of additional weeks or hours in a payment period has no effect on the scheduled payment periods for purposes of determining Pell Grant and TEACH Grant payment amounts, an undergraduate student who accelerates in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year of a program. Specifically, if a student enrolled in a program that is greater than one academic year in length completes additional clock or credit hours prior to the final academic year of the program, this may result in a final period of study that contains fewer clock or credit hours than the number of hours in the program9s defined academic year. In this circumstance, the Direct Loan annual loan limit for an undergraduate student must be prorated (reduced). The principles described above are illustrated by the examples in Appendix A at the end of this chapter. For guidance on calculating Pell Grant and TEACH Grant awards for clock-hour and non-term credit-hour programs, see Volume 7. For information on Direct Loan annual loan limit proration and annual loan limit progression in clock-hour and non-term credit- hour programs, see Volume 8, Chapters 5 and 6. If your school is unable to determine when a student has successfully completed half of the credit or clock hours in a program, academic year, or remainder of a program, the student is considered to have begun the second payment period of the program, academic year, or remainder of a program at the later of the date (identified by your school) that the student has successfully completed: half of the academic coursework in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program; or half of the number of weeks of instructional time in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program.', '<2-hop>\n\nnon-term (includes clock-hour calendars), or subscription-based.

In a non-term academic calendar, classes do not begin and end within a set time frame, such as a term. Academic progress in a non-term program can be measured in either credit or clock hours. In some cases (as discussed below), a program with terms must be treated as a non-term program for Title IV purposes. A subscription-based academic calendar is used only by subscription-based programs. A subscription-based program is a term-based program in which the school charges a student for each term on a subscription basis with the expectation that the student will complete a specified number of credit hours (or the equivalent) during that term.

Substantially equal nonstandard terms may be of any length, but if they are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for purposes of monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6 for more information on BBAY 3). Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length are not permissible in a subscription-based academic calendar. The term ""subscription period"" is synonymous with ""term"" and ""payment period"" (payment periods are covered later in this chapter).

1. Clock-hour or Non-term Credit-hour Programs:
   - Use a Base Year (BBAY) and Formula 4 for disbursement calculations.
   - Require a minimum 30-week academic year.
   - Satisfactory academic progress must be maintained.
   - Disbursement is based on the student's enrollment in clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs, which often have flexible schedules.

2. Subscription-based Academic Calendars:
   - Pell Grant disbursement follows the specific academic calendar schedule of the institution.
   - The exact requirements for disbursement are not detailed on the federal website and are typically determined by the college's financial aid office.
   - These programs may have varying start and end dates, affecting the timing of disbursements.

Implications for Payment Periods and Academic Progress Measurement:
- For clock-hour or non-term programs, payment periods are often aligned with the 30-week academic year and the student's progress in clock-hours or credit-hours.
- For subscription-based calendars, payment periods are tied to the institution's academic calendar, which may be shorter or irregular, requiring careful coordination to ensure disbursements align with academic progress.
- Academic progress measurement must consider the specific calendar type, with clock-hour programs focusing on clock-hours completed and subscription-based programs aligning with scheduled terms.

For precise details, especially regarding subscription-based calendars, it is recommended to consult the college's financial aid office.","In clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs, Pell Grant disbursement is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods established at the beginning of the program. These scheduled payment periods do not change regardless of a student's rate of progression, meaning that even if a student completes additional weeks or hours, the payment periods used to determine Pell Grant amounts remain fixed. Academic progress in these programs is measured by the completion of credit or clock hours and weeks of instructional time, and disbursement for the next payment period cannot occur until both measures are met. In contrast, subscription-based academic calendars are term-based but do not require classes to begin or end within a specific timeframe for each term. Instead, students are charged on a subscription basis with the expectation of completing a specified number of credit hours per term. Payment periods in subscription-based programs are synonymous with 'subscription periods' or 'terms,' and Pell Grant awards are calculated using Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3, depending on the program structure.
