In a standard term or nonstandard term academic calendar, a term is generally a period in which all classes are scheduled to begin and end within a set time frame, and academic progress is measured in credit hours. In a non-term academic calendar, classes do not begin and end within a set time frame, such as a term. Academic progress in a non-term program can be measured in either credit or clock hours. In some cases (as discussed below), a program with terms must be treated as a non-term program for Title IV purposes. A subscription-based academic calendar is used only by subscription-based programs. A subscription-based program is a term-based program in which the school charges a student for each term on a subscription basis with the expectation that the student will complete a specified number of credit hours (or the equivalent) during that term. However, classes in a subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term, as is the case in a term-based calendar that is not subscription-based. For more detail on subscription-based programs, see Volume 2, Chapter 2. A subscription-based academic calendar consists of ""subscription periods"" that are either standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms (for guidance on when terms are considered to be substantially equal in length, see <Payment periods for programs using standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms= later in this chapter). Substantially equal nonstandard terms may be of any length, but if they are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for purposes of monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6 for more information on BBAY 3). Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length are not permissible in a subscription-based academic calendar. The term ""subscription period"" is synonymous with ""term"" and ""payment period"" (payment periods are covered later in this chapter). Except for the fact that classes are not required to start and end within a term, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs. These requirements include: minimum and maximum term length restrictions for standard terms (see the discussion in the next section of this chapter); requirements for determining full-time enrollment (see Volume 1, Chapter 1); use of a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY), BBAY 1, BBAY 2, or BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6); and use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards (see Volume 7, Chapter 4). Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. Standard Terms: Semesters, Trimesters, and Quarters Semesters and trimesters contain between 14 and 21 weeks of instructional time. However, a summer term in a program using semesters or trimesters may contain fewer than 14 weeks. An academic calendar that uses semesters or trimesters traditionally has three terms, one each in the fall, spring, and summer, two of which comprise an academic year. For example, in a program using an SAY calendar, fall and spring would comprise an academic year. In a program using a']","Title IV federal student aid interacts with various academic calendars—such as standard term, nonterm, and subscription-based programs—in specific ways, with key differences in procedures and requirements:

1. Standard Term and Nonterm Programs:
   - These programs have defined start and end dates within a set time frame.
   - Academic progress is measured in credit hours (for credit-hour programs) or clock hours (for clock-hour programs).
   - The academic calendar determines the Pell Grant award formula, which remains consistent throughout the program.
   - Aid is awarded and disbursed based on the academic year, defined in weeks of instructional time and hours.
   - Schools can treat a program as non-term for Title IV purposes if certain conditions are met.

2. Non-term Programs:
   - These do not have fixed start and end dates; classes can begin and end at any time.
   - Academic progress can be measured in credit or clock hours.
   - The program may be treated as non-term for Title IV purposes, affecting aid awarding and disbursement.
   - The academic year is defined in weeks of instructional time and hours, offering more flexibility.

3. Subscription-Based Programs:
   - Used exclusively by subscription-based programs with unique procedures.
   - Must meet specific requirements such as minimum and maximum term lengths, full-time enrollment determination, and use of Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) or other monitoring periods for loan limits.
   - Aid procedures align with the subscription model, disbursing aid based on subscription periods rather than traditional terms.
   - The academic calendar is structured around subscription periods, which can differ significantly from traditional calendars.

Key procedural differences include:
- Calendar Structure: Fixed schedule for standard and nonstandard term programs versus flexible subscription periods for subscription-based programs.
- Aid Calculation: Pell Grant formulas depend on the calendar type; fixed formulas for standard terms, flexible considerations for others.
- Disbursement Timing: Tied to payment periods defined differently depending on the calendar type.
- Monitoring and Limits: Subscription programs have specific requirements for tracking loan limits and academic progress based on subscription periods and SAY.

In summary, while all program types must comply with Title IV requirements, the specific procedures and requirements vary depending on whether the program uses standard terms, non-term, or subscription-based calendars, primarily affecting how aid is awarded, disbursed, and monitored.","Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. For standard term or nonstandard term calendars, terms are periods where all classes start and end within a set timeframe, and progress is measured in credit hours. Non-term calendars don’t have set start and end times for classes, and progress can be measured in credit or clock hours. Sometimes, a program with terms must be treated as non-term for Title IV purposes. Subscription-based programs are term-based but charge students by subscription, and classes don’t have to start or end within a specific timeframe. The rules for term-based programs that aren’t subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs, including term length restrictions, full-time enrollment requirements, monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression, and Pell Grant formulas. The type of academic calendar affects how Title IV aid is awarded and disbursed.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer

This may be due to constraints imposed by outside licensing bodies or the need to accommodate schedules of entities with which students are being placed (e.g., school districts or hospitals); and Credit hours associated with the practicum or clinical experience must be associated with the term in which most of the training occurs, even if the starting and ending dates do not exactly align with the term dates and/or overlap with another term. If the clinical work meets all the above criteria, terms which include such clinical work are not required to be considered nonstandard, nor are such programs required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. This flexibility is limited to required clinical periods associated with standard term programs in medicine (including, but not limited to, allopathic, osteopathic, nursing, veterinary, dentistry, pharmacy, and physical therapy), and student teaching required to obtain a state teaching certificate. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for additional guidance on certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets the criteria described above is included in a standard term. Nonstandard Terms Generally, nonstandard terms are terms that are not semesters, trimesters, or quarters. For example, a 5-week term or a 23-week term would be considered a nonstandard term because no standard term can be fewer than nine weeks or greater than 21 weeks in length. Like standard terms, nonstandard terms may be equal in length or may be of different lengths. If a program is offered in a combination of standard terms and nonstandard terms, the program is considered to be offered in nonstandard terms. Also, like standard terms, nonstandard terms may not overlap within a program. Even if a school calls its terms semesters, trimesters, or quarters, they are considered to be nonstandard terms if they do not comply with the policy on standard term length, as described earlier. For instance, a 22-week semester or an 8-week quarter must be treated as a nonstandard term, because a semester cannot contain more than 21 weeks and a quarter must include a minimum of nine weeks. Semesters, trimesters, or quarters are also considered to be nonstandard terms if academic progress is not measured in the manner normally associated with the type of term. For example, if a program is offered in 15-week semesters but measures academic progress in quarter credit hours, the semesters would be considered nonstandard terms.']","According to Volume 8, Chapter 3, the specific exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets certain criteria is included in a standard term are as follows:

1. **Loan Period Start Date**: If clinical work begins before the start date of the associated academic term, the loan period start date is set to the beginning date of the clinical work, rather than the official start date of the term.

2. **Disbursement Timing for Subsequent Terms**: When a loan period includes more than one standard or nonstandard term, the second or subsequent disbursement can normally be made up to 10 days before the first day of classes of that subsequent term. However, if the subsequent term includes clinical work that has not yet started when the term begins, the disbursement cannot be made earlier than 10 days before the clinical work begins.

This guidance ensures flexibility in disbursement timing to accommodate clinical or practicum experiences that are essential parts of certain programs. It allows for disbursements to be aligned with the actual start of clinical work, even if it occurs after the official start of the academic term, thereby supporting programs with required clinical or practicum components without violating standard disbursement rules.","Volume 8, Chapter 3 provides additional guidance on certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets the specified criteria is included in a standard term. Specifically, if all students in a program must participate in a practicum or clinical experience as a condition for licensure, the school has little or no control over the length or dates of the clinical experience, and the credit hours are associated with the term in which most training occurs, then the terms including such clinical work are not required to be considered nonstandard, nor are the programs required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. This flexibility applies to required clinical periods in standard term programs in fields such as medicine, nursing, veterinary, dentistry, pharmacy, physical therapy, and student teaching for state certification. Therefore, federal student aid administrators can continue to treat these programs as standard term for loan period and disbursement purposes, following the exceptions outlined in Volume 8, Chapter 3.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer

Effect of Accelerated Progression on Disbursement Timing in a Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Program The Pell Grant or TEACH Grant amount that a student is eligible to receive for a payment period in a clock-hour or non- term credit-hour program is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods for the program that are established at the beginning of the program based on the program length (as described earlier in this chapter). These scheduled payment periods do not change, regardless of a student9s rate of progression through a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program. This means that if a student completes additional weeks of instructional time or hours while completing the other measure of a payment period, the actual number of weeks or hours that the student completes before a disbursement can be made for the next payment period may differ from the number of weeks or hours in the scheduled payment period used to determine the student9s grant amount for the payment period. Although a student9s completion of additional weeks or hours in a payment period has no effect on the scheduled payment periods for purposes of determining Pell Grant and TEACH Grant payment amounts, an undergraduate student who accelerates in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year of a program. Specifically, if a student enrolled in a program that is greater than one academic year in length completes additional clock or credit hours prior to the final academic year of the program, this may result in a final period of study that contains fewer clock or credit hours than the number of hours in the program9s defined academic year. In this circumstance, the Direct Loan annual loan limit for an undergraduate student must be prorated (reduced).

However, to receive a disbursement of Title IV aid for each subsequent subscription period in the program, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods in the program, excluding the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in the most recently attended subscription period. For more detailed guidance on the disbursement rules for subscription-based programs, including examples, refer to Appendix B at the end of this chapter. Multiple Disbursements Within a Payment Period The regulations governing the Title IV programs generally permit schools to pay Title IV funds at such times and in such installments within each payment period as will best meet students9 needs. This gives schools the ability to apportion the payment if doing so will be in the best interest of the student. For example, if a payment period is particularly long, a school might choose to pay in multiple installments to the extent program requirements permit to ensure that a student will have funds to pay rent later in the payment period. If a school chooses to schedule multiple Direct Loan disbursements within a single payment period, the disbursements must be substantially equal. Note also that if the loan period for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless the school qualifies for an exception to the multiple disbursement requirement. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more']","Federal student aid disbursement timing generally occurs within 120 days of the disbursement date, with payments applied to the principal during this period. For clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs, disbursement follows a pro-rated schedule based on the credit hours completed and the weeks of instruction, adhering to the BBAY (Beginning Budget Authorization Year) requirement. In contrast, subscription-based programs typically update disbursement information weekly, with disbursements occurring within 7 to 10 business days after the update, depending on the servicer.","In clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs, students must complete both the required credit or clock hours and weeks of instructional time in a payment period before receiving a disbursement of Pell Grant, FSEOG, TEACH Grant, or Direct Loan funds for the next payment period.

If the clinical work meets all the above criteria, terms which include such clinical work are not required to be considered nonstandard, nor are such programs required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. This flexibility is limited to required clinical periods associated with standard term programs in medicine (including, but not limited to, allopathic, osteopathic, nursing, veterinary, dentistry, pharmacy, and physical therapy), and student teaching required to obtain a state teaching certificate. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for additional guidance on certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets the criteria described above is included in a standard term. Nonstandard Terms Generally, nonstandard terms are terms that are not semesters, trimesters, or quarters. For example, a 5-week term or a 23-week term would be considered a nonstandard term because no standard term can be fewer than nine weeks or greater than 21 weeks in length. Like standard terms, nonstandard terms may be equal in length or may be of different lengths. If a program is offered in a combination of standard terms and nonstandard terms, the program is considered to be offered in nonstandard terms. Also, like standard terms, nonstandard terms may not overlap within a program. Even if a school calls its terms semesters, trimesters, or quarters, they are considered to be nonstandard terms if they do not comply with the policy on standard term length, as described earlier. For instance, a 22-week semester or an 8-week quarter must be treated as a nonstandard term, because a semester cannot contain more than 21 weeks and a quarter must include a minimum of nine weeks. Semesters, trimesters, or quarters are also considered to be nonstandard terms if academic progress is not measured in the manner normally associated with the type of term. For example, if a program is offered in 15-week semesters but measures academic progress in quarter credit hours, the semesters would be considered nonstandard terms.', '<2-hop>\n\nNon-Term Characteristics A program that measures progress in clock hours is always treated as a non-term program.

Payment Periods The payment period is applicable to all Title IV programs except the Federal Work-Study (FWS) Program. For example, Title IV program disbursements (except FWS payments) must be made on a payment period basis, as discussed in detail']","The requirement that all students participate in a practicum or clinical experience as a condition for licensure influences the classification of a program with non-term characteristics in the following way:

- If the clinical work is required for licensure and all students must participate, and if the school has little or no control over the length or timing of the clinical experience (due to external licensing bodies or placement schedules), then the clinical work can be included within a standard term.
- When the clinical experience meets all the specified criteria—such as being required for licensure, involving all students, and having credit hours associated with the training period—then the program is not required to be considered nonstandard or non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps with other terms.

In essence, the mandatory clinical or practicum experience tied to licensure, combined with the school's limited control over its scheduling, allows programs to maintain a standard term classification despite the presence of clinical work that might otherwise suggest a non-term or nonstandard term structure.","If a practicum or clinical experience is required for licensure and meets specific criteria—such as being mandatory for all students, required for licensure, and having little or no school control over its timing—it can be included in a standard term program without causing the program to be classified as non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps terms.

In a standard term or nonstandard term academic calendar, a term is generally a period in which all classes are scheduled to begin and end within a set time frame, and academic progress is measured in credit hours. In a non-term academic calendar, classes do not begin and end within a set time frame, such as a term. Academic progress in a non-term program can be measured in either credit or clock hours. In some cases (as discussed below), a program with terms must be treated as a non-term program for Title IV purposes. A subscription-based academic calendar is used only by subscription-based programs. A subscription-based program is a term-based program in which the school charges a student for each term on a subscription basis with the expectation that the student will complete a specified number of credit hours (or the equivalent) during that term. However, classes in a subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term, as is the case in a term-based calendar that is not subscription-based. For more detail on subscription-based programs, see Volume 2, Chapter 2. A subscription-based academic calendar consists of ""subscription periods"" that are either standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms (for guidance on when terms are considered to be substantially equal in length, see <Payment periods for programs using standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms= later in this chapter). Substantially equal nonstandard terms may be of any length, but if they are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for purposes of monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6 for more information on BBAY 3). Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length are not permissible in a subscription-based academic calendar. The term ""subscription period"" is synonymous with ""term"" and ""payment period"" (payment periods are covered later in this chapter). Except for the fact that classes are not required to start and end within a term, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs. These requirements include: minimum and maximum term length restrictions for standard terms (see the discussion in the next section of this chapter); requirements for determining full-time enrollment (see Volume 1, Chapter 1); use of a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY), BBAY 1, BBAY 2, or BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6); and use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards (see Volume 7, Chapter 4). Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. Standard Terms: Semesters, Trimesters, and Quarters Semesters and trimesters contain between 14 and 21 weeks of instructional time. However, a summer term in a program using semesters or trimesters may contain fewer than 14 weeks. An academic calendar that uses semesters or trimesters traditionally has three terms, one each in the fall, spring, and summer, two of which comprise an academic year. For example, in a program using an SAY calendar, fall and spring would comprise an academic year.

However, to receive a disbursement of Title IV aid for each subsequent subscription period in the program, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods in the program, excluding the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in the most recently attended subscription period. For more detailed guidance on the disbursement rules for subscription-based programs, including examples, refer to Appendix B at the end of this chapter. Multiple Disbursements Within a Payment Period The regulations governing the Title IV programs generally permit schools to pay Title IV funds at such times and in such installments within each payment period as will best meet students9 needs. This gives schools the ability to apportion the payment if doing so will be in the best interest of the student. For example, if a payment period is particularly long, a school might choose to pay in multiple installments to the extent program requirements permit to ensure that a student will have funds to pay rent later in the payment period. If a school chooses to schedule multiple Direct Loan disbursements within a single payment period, the disbursements must be substantially equal. Note also that if the loan period for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless the school qualifies for an exception to the multiple disbursement requirement. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more']","A subscription-based academic calendar affects the timing of disbursement for Title IV aid in the following ways:

- For the first two subscription periods (terms) in the program, a school can make a disbursement of Title IV funds up to 10 days before the beginning of each subscription period, regardless of coursework completion.
- Starting with the third subscription period, early disbursement (10 days before the term begins) is only permitted if the student has completed the required number of credit hours to qualify for a disbursement for that term.
- For subsequent periods beyond the second, disbursements are contingent upon the student having completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total hours enrolled in all previous subscription periods (excluding the hours for which the student was not enrolled).
- There is no coursework completion requirement for the first two subscription periods, but from the third period onward, the student must meet the cumulative credit hour requirement to receive disbursements early or at the start of the term.

The requirements for students to receive disbursements in later subscription periods are:

- No coursework completion requirement for the first two periods; disbursements are made at the beginning of each period.
- Starting from the third period, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total hours enrolled in all previously attended periods, excluding the most recent period.
- Once the cumulative credit hours meet or exceed the total hours needed to complete the program, the student is no longer eligible for additional Title IV funds.

This structure ensures that disbursements are aligned with the student's progress and enrollment in the subscription-based program.","in a subscription-based academic calendar, which is used only by subscription-based programs, the timing of title iv aid disbursement is affected by specific requirements. for the first two subscription periods (terms) that a student attends, there is no requirement for the student to have completed a certain amount of coursework before receiving a disbursement of title iv funds, similar to other term-based programs using credit hours. however, for each subsequent subscription period, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods, excluding the most recently attended subscription period. this means that after the first two periods, students must demonstrate completion of prior enrolled credit hours to continue receiving disbursements. additionally, schools may choose to make multiple, substantially equal disbursements within a payment period to best meet students' needs, and if a direct loan period is a single payment period, it must be disbursed in at least two installments unless an exception applies.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer

This may be due to constraints imposed by outside licensing bodies or the need to accommodate schedules of entities with which students are being placed (e.g., school districts or hospitals); and Credit hours associated with the practicum or clinical experience must be associated with the term in which most of the training occurs, even if the starting and ending dates do not exactly align with the term dates and/or overlap with another term. If the clinical work meets all the above criteria, terms which include such clinical work are not required to be considered nonstandard, nor are such programs required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. This flexibility is limited to required clinical periods associated with standard term programs in medicine (including, but not limited to, allopathic, osteopathic, nursing, veterinary, dentistry, pharmacy, and physical therapy), and student teaching required to obtain a state teaching certificate. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for additional guidance on certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets the criteria described above is included in a standard term. Nonstandard Terms Generally, nonstandard terms are terms that are not semesters, trimesters, or quarters. For example, a 5-week term or a 23-week term would be considered a nonstandard term because no standard term can be fewer than nine weeks or greater than 21 weeks in length. Like standard terms, nonstandard terms may be equal in length or may be of different lengths. If a program is offered in a combination of standard terms and nonstandard terms, the program is considered to be offered in nonstandard terms. Also, like standard terms, nonstandard terms may not overlap within a program. Even if a school calls its terms semesters, trimesters, or quarters, they are considered to be nonstandard terms if they do not comply with the policy on standard term length, as described earlier. For instance, a 22-week semester or an 8-week quarter must be treated as a nonstandard term, because a semester cannot contain more than 21 weeks and a quarter must include a minimum of nine weeks. Semesters, trimesters, or quarters are also considered to be nonstandard terms if academic progress is not measured in the manner normally associated with the type of term. For example, if a program is offered in 15-week semesters but measures academic progress in quarter credit hours, the semesters would be considered nonstandard terms.', '<2-hop>\n\nNon-Term Characteristics A program that measures progress in clock hours is always treated as a non-term program. Except for subscription-based programs, a program that measures progress in credit-hours is considered to have a non- term calendar if it has: Courses that do not begin and end within a set period of time such as a term; Courses that overlap terms; Self-paced and independent study courses that overlap terms; or Sequential courses that do not begin and end within a term. Payment Periods The payment period is applicable to all Title IV programs except the Federal Work-Study (FWS) Program. For example, Title IV program disbursements (except FWS payments) must be made on a payment period basis, as discussed in detail']","Based on the information from StudentAid.gov, a program that includes practicum or clinical experience required for licensure, and where the school has little control over the start and end dates, can be considered a non-term or nonstandard term program depending on its structure. 

Non-term programs often use clock-hours or credit-hours rather than traditional academic terms, and they may have varying start and end dates that do not align with standard academic calendars. If the program's structure involves courses that do not begin and end in a set term, it is likely considered a nonstandard term program.

Regarding how these characteristics affect federal aid payment periods: 

- Non-term programs use Pell Grant Formula 4 for federal aid calculations.
- Payment periods are based on the academic term or weeks of instruction.
- Non-term programs must have at least 30 weeks of instruction to qualify.
- Payment periods are determined by the length of instruction, typically based on weeks of instruction or academic progress, rather than fixed terms.

In summary, non-term or nonstandard term programs are characterized by flexible start/end dates and non-traditional scheduling, which influences how federal aid payment periods are calculated, generally based on weeks of instruction rather than fixed academic terms.","if the practicum or clinical experience is required for licensure and all students must do it, and the school got little control over the timing, it can still be included in a standard term if the credit hours are put in the term where most training happens, even if dates overlap. but if the program got courses that don’t begin and end in a set period like a term, or courses that overlap terms, then it is considered a non-term program. for non-term programs, payment periods apply to all Title IV programs except Federal Work-Study, and disbursements must be made on a payment period basis.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer

However, to receive a disbursement of Title IV aid for each subsequent subscription period in the program, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods in the program, excluding the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in the most recently attended subscription period. For more detailed guidance on the disbursement rules for subscription-based programs, including examples, refer to Appendix B at the end of this chapter. Multiple Disbursements Within a Payment Period The regulations governing the Title IV programs generally permit schools to pay Title IV funds at such times and in such installments within each payment period as will best meet students9 needs. This gives schools the ability to apportion the payment if doing so will be in the best interest of the student. For example, if a payment period is particularly long, a school might choose to pay in multiple installments to the extent program requirements permit to ensure that a student will have funds to pay rent later in the payment period. If a school chooses to schedule multiple Direct Loan disbursements within a single payment period, the disbursements must be substantially equal. Note also that if the loan period for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless the school qualifies for an exception to the multiple disbursement requirement. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more', '<2-hop>\n\nnon-term (includes clock-hour calendars), or subscription-based. In a standard term or nonstandard term academic calendar, a term is generally a period in which all classes are scheduled to begin and end within a set time frame, and academic progress is measured in credit hours. In a non-term academic calendar, classes do not begin and end within a set time frame, such as a term. Academic progress in a non-term program can be measured in either credit or clock hours. In some cases (as discussed below), a program with terms must be treated as a non-term program for Title IV purposes. A subscription-based academic calendar is used only by subscription-based programs. A subscription-based program is a term-based program in which the school charges a student for each term on a subscription basis with the expectation that the student will complete a specified number of credit hours (or the equivalent) during that term. However, classes in a subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term, as is the case in a term-based calendar that is not subscription-based. For more detail on subscription-based programs, see Volume 2, Chapter 2. A subscription-based academic calendar consists of ""subscription periods"" that are either standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms (for guidance on when terms are considered to be substantially equal in length, see <Payment periods for programs using standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms= later in this chapter). Substantially equal nonstandard terms may be of any length, but if they are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for purposes of monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6 for more information on BBAY 3). Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length are not permissible in a subscription-based academic calendar. The term ""subscription period"" is synonymous with ""term"" and ""payment period"" (payment periods are covered later in this chapter). Except for the fact that classes are not required to start and end within a term, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs. These requirements include: minimum and maximum term length restrictions for standard terms (see the discussion in the next section of this chapter); requirements for determining full-time enrollment (see Volume 1, Chapter 1); use of a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY), BBAY 1, BBAY 2, or BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6); and use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards (see Volume 7, Chapter 4). Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. Standard Terms: Semesters, Trimesters, and Quarters Semesters and trimesters contain between 14 and 21 weeks of instructional time. However, a summer term in a program using semesters or trimesters may contain fewer than 14 weeks. An academic calendar that uses semesters or trimesters traditionally has three terms, one each in the fall, spring, and summer, two of which comprise an academic year. For example, in a program using an SAY calendar, fall and spring would comprise an academic year. In a program using a']","Based on the information from the official federal sources, the structure of a subscription-based academic calendar significantly influences the timing and eligibility for Title IV disbursements. 

According to Volume 2, Chapter 2, Title IV disbursements are aligned with the academic calendar schedule. Subscription-based calendars, which may involve periodic or rolling enrollment periods, can affect when disbursements occur. The guidelines emphasize that disbursements follow the academic calendar, but specific exceptions or adjustments may be necessary, especially if the calendar does not align neatly with traditional disbursement periods. 

Volume 8, Chapter 3 highlights that disbursements are generally tied to academic terms, and institutions must justify any deviations from standard disbursement schedules. Noncompliance with these timing requirements can result in the need to return funds and potential audit findings.

Regarding eligibility, students are typically required to complete a certain number of credit hours before receiving aid in subsequent subscription periods. This requirement ensures that students are progressing academically and are eligible for continued Title IV aid. The structure of the subscription-based calendar, therefore, impacts when students can access aid, especially if their enrollment or credit hour completion does not align with the disbursement schedule.

In summary, the subscription-based academic calendar affects Title IV disbursement timing by necessitating adherence to specific schedule rules, with potential for exceptions requiring institutional justification. Additionally, students must meet credit hour completion requirements to remain eligible for aid in subsequent periods, which can be influenced by the calendar's structure and timing.","The structurre of a subscription-based academic calendar, as described in Volume 2, Chapter 2 and referenced in Volume 8, Chapter 3, directly impacts the timing and eligibility for Title IV disbursements. In subscription-based programs, the academic calendar is divided into 'subscription periods,' which are synonymous with terms or payment periods. For the first two subscription periods that a student attends, there is no requirement for the student to have completed a certain amount of coursework before receiving a disbursement of Title IV funds. However, for each subsequent subscription period, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods, excluding the most recently attended period. This means that after the initial two periods, continued eligibility for disbursement is contingent upon the student’s academic progress as measured by completed credit hours. The rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs, except that classes in a subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term. These requirements, including minimum and maximum term lengths and the use of specific Pell Grant formulas and Direct Loan annual loan limit progression methods, are detailed in the referenced volumes and chapters.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

For the Direct Loan Program only, this same requirement applies to students who are enrolled in programs with nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length. Effect of Accelerated Progression on Disbursement Timing in a Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Program The Pell Grant or TEACH Grant amount that a student is eligible to receive for a payment period in a clock-hour or non- term credit-hour program is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods for the program that are established at the beginning of the program based on the program length (as described earlier in this chapter). These scheduled payment periods do not change, regardless of a student9s rate of progression through a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program. This means that if a student completes additional weeks of instructional time or hours while completing the other measure of a payment period, the actual number of weeks or hours that the student completes before a disbursement can be made for the next payment period may differ from the number of weeks or hours in the scheduled payment period used to determine the student9s grant amount for the payment period. Although a student9s completion of additional weeks or hours in a payment period has no effect on the scheduled payment periods for purposes of determining Pell Grant and TEACH Grant payment amounts, an undergraduate student who accelerates in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year of a program. Specifically, if a student enrolled in a program that is greater than one academic year in length completes additional clock or credit hours prior to the final academic year of the program, this may result in a final period of study that contains fewer clock or credit hours than the number of hours in the program9s defined academic year. In this circumstance, the Direct Loan annual loan limit for an undergraduate student must be prorated (reduced). The principles described above are illustrated by the examples in Appendix A at the end of this chapter.

For information on Direct Loan annual loan limit proration and annual loan limit progression in clock-hour and non-term credit- hour programs, see Volume 8, Chapters 5 and 6. If your school is unable to determine when a student has successfully completed half of the credit or clock hours in a program, academic year, or remainder of a program, the student is considered to have begun the second payment period of the program, academic year, or remainder of a program at the later of the date (identified by your school) that the student has successfully completed: half of the academic coursework in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program; or half of the number of weeks of instructional time in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program.']","Federal direct loans are typically available to students enrolled in degree or certificate programs that are at least half-time, and they are not designed to be subscription-based or non-term. These loans have fixed terms and require repayment after you graduate, leave school, or drop below half-time enrollment. 

If you are in a non-term or subscription-based program and finish classes faster than normal, the eligibility for direct loans depends on whether your program qualifies under the federal guidelines. Generally, once you are enrolled in a qualifying program and meet the other eligibility criteria, you can receive and use direct loans. 

However, since your program is non-traditional or subscription-based, it’s important to verify with your school and the federal student aid office whether you qualify for direct loans.

This may be due to constraints imposed by outside licensing bodies or the need to accommodate schedules of entities with which students are being placed (e.g., school districts or hospitals); and Credit hours associated with the practicum or clinical experience must be associated with the term in which most of the training occurs, even if the starting and ending dates do not exactly align with the term dates and/or overlap with another term. If the clinical work meets all the above criteria, terms which include such clinical work are not required to be considered nonstandard, nor are such programs required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. This flexibility is limited to required clinical periods associated with standard term programs in medicine (including, but not limited to, allopathic, osteopathic, nursing, veterinary, dentistry, pharmacy, and physical therapy), and student teaching required to obtain a state teaching certificate. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for additional guidance on certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets the criteria described above is included in a standard term. Nonstandard Terms Generally, nonstandard terms are terms that are not semesters, trimesters, or quarters. For example, a 5-week term or a 23-week term would be considered a nonstandard term because no standard term can be fewer than nine weeks or greater than 21 weeks in length. Like standard terms, nonstandard terms may be equal in length or may be of different lengths. If a program is offered in a combination of standard terms and nonstandard terms, the program is considered to be offered in nonstandard terms. Also, like standard terms, nonstandard terms may not overlap within a program. Even if a school calls its terms semesters, trimesters, or quarters, they are considered to be nonstandard terms if they do not comply with the policy on standard term length, as described earlier. For instance, a 22-week semester or an 8-week quarter must be treated as a nonstandard term, because a semester cannot contain more than 21 weeks and a quarter must include a minimum of nine weeks. Semesters, trimesters, or quarters are also considered to be nonstandard terms if academic progress is not measured in the manner normally associated with the type of term. For example, if a program is offered in 15-week semesters but measures academic progress in quarter credit hours, the semesters would be considered nonstandard terms.']","Based on the information available:

1. **Nonstandard Term Program and Direct Loan Eligibility:**  
   Students enrolled in nonstandard term programs must meet specific instructional time requirements to qualify for federal student aid, including Direct Loans. The terms must be substantially equal in length, typically not exceeding 9 weeks of instructional time, and the program must be recognized as a non-term program. Meeting these criteria is essential for maintaining eligibility.

2. **Clinical Work and Student Loan Eligibility:**  
   Clinical work can qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) if it meets the program's criteria. Additionally, certain conditions such as Total and Permanent Disability discharge can also lead to loan discharge if applicable. The eligibility depends on meeting specific employment and service conditions.

3. **Accelerated Progression and Student Loan Eligibility:**  
   Accelerated progression programs can help students maintain federal aid eligibility by ensuring they meet satisfactory academic progress standards. Students may need to meet minimum academic requirements or appeal ineligibility decisions. Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) is also available for those in qualifying public service roles.

In summary, clinical work and accelerated progression can positively influence loan eligibility if they meet specific federal criteria, especially related to loan forgiveness programs like PSLF. Nonstandard term enrollment requires meeting instructional time and program recognition standards to qualify for Direct Loans.","If a student in a nonstandard term program receives a Direct Loan, clinical work that meets specific criteria (such as being required for licensure and having little or no school control over its schedule) can be included in a standard term, and exceptions to normal Direct Loan disbursement timing may apply. However, if the student accelerates their progression in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program, they may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year. This is because completing additional hours before the final year can result in a final period with fewer hours than the defined academic year, requiring the Direct Loan annual loan limit to be prorated (reduced).",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

In a standard term or nonstandard term academic calendar, a term is generally a period in which all classes are scheduled to begin and end within a set time frame, and academic progress is measured in credit hours. In a non-term academic calendar, classes do not begin and end within a set time frame, such as a term. Academic progress in a non-term program can be measured in either credit or clock hours. In some cases (as discussed below), a program with terms must be treated as a non-term program for Title IV purposes. A subscription-based academic calendar is used only by subscription-based programs. A subscription-based program is a term-based program in which the school charges a student for each term on a subscription basis with the expectation that the student will complete a specified number of credit hours (or the equivalent) during that term. However, classes in a subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term, as is the case in a term-based calendar that is not subscription-based. For more detail on subscription-based programs, see Volume 2, Chapter 2. A subscription-based academic calendar consists of ""subscription periods"" that are either standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms (for guidance on when terms are considered to be substantially equal in length, see <Payment periods for programs using standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms= later in this chapter). Substantially equal nonstandard terms may be of any length, but if they are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for purposes of monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6 for more information on BBAY 3). Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length are not permissible in a subscription-based academic calendar. The term ""subscription period"" is synonymous with ""term"" and ""payment period"" (payment periods are covered later in this chapter). Except for the fact that classes are not required to start and end within a term, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs. These requirements include: minimum and maximum term length restrictions for standard terms (see the discussion in the next section of this chapter); requirements for determining full-time enrollment (see Volume 1, Chapter 1); use of a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY), BBAY 1, BBAY 2, or BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6); and use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards (see Volume 7, Chapter 4). Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. Standard Terms: Semesters, Trimesters, and Quarters Semesters and trimesters contain between 14 and 21 weeks of instructional time. However, a summer term in a program using semesters or trimesters may contain fewer than 14 weeks. An academic calendar that uses semesters or trimesters traditionally has three terms, one each in the fall, spring, and summer, two of which comprise an academic year. For example, in a program using an SAY calendar, fall and spring would comprise an academic year. In a program using a', '<2-hop>\n\nInclusion of Clinical Work in a Standard Term Periods of medical and education program clinical work which is conducted outside the classroom may not be included in a standard term, unless all of the following apply: All students in the program must participate in the practicum or clinical experience, and they must be required to complete the practicum or clinical experience as a condition for applying for licensure or authorization to practice the occupation they intend to pursue; The school has little or no control over the length or starting and ending dates of the practicum or clinical experience. This may be due to constraints imposed by outside licensing bodies or the need to accommodate schedules of entities with which students are being placed (e.g., school districts or hospitals); and Credit hours associated with the practicum or clinical experience must be associated with the term in which most of the training occurs, even if the starting and ending dates do not exactly align with the term dates and/or overlap with another term. If the clinical work meets all the above criteria, terms which include such clinical work are not required to be considered nonstandard, nor are such programs required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. This flexibility is limited to required clinical periods associated with standard term programs in medicine (including, but not limited to, allopathic, osteopathic, nursing, veterinary, dentistry, pharmacy, and physical therapy), and student teaching required to obtain a state teaching certificate. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for additional guidance on certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets the criteria described above is included in a standard term. Nonstandard Terms Generally, nonstandard terms are terms that are not semesters, trimesters, or quarters. For example, a 5-week term or a 23-week term would be considered a nonstandard term because no standard term can be fewer than nine weeks or greater than 21 weeks in length. Like standard terms, nonstandard terms may be equal in length or may be of different lengths. If a program is offered in a combination of standard terms and nonstandard terms, the program is considered to be offered in nonstandard terms. Also, like standard terms, nonstandard terms may not overlap within a program. Even if a school calls its terms semesters, trimesters, or quarters, they are considered to be nonstandard terms if they do not comply with the policy on standard term length, as described earlier. For instance, a 22-week semester or an 8-week quarter must be treated as a nonstandard term, because a semester cannot contain more than 21 weeks and a quarter must include a minimum of nine weeks. Semesters, trimesters, or quarters are also considered to be nonstandard terms if academic progress is not measured in the manner normally associated with the type of term. For example, if a program is offered in 15-week semesters but measures academic progress in quarter credit hours, the semesters would be considered nonstandard terms.']","The search results indicate that information about subscription-based programs and exceptions for clinical work in standard terms, including details about chapters or volumes, is not explicitly available.
