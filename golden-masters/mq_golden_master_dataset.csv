In a standard term or nonstandard term academic calendar, a term is generally a period in which all classes are scheduled to begin and end within a set time frame, and academic progress is measured in credit hours. In a non-term academic calendar, classes do not begin and end within a set time frame, such as a term. Academic progress in a non-term program can be measured in either credit or clock hours. In some cases (as discussed below), a program with terms must be treated as a non-term program for Title IV purposes. A subscription-based academic calendar is used only by subscription-based programs. A subscription-based program is a term-based program in which the school charges a student for each term on a subscription basis with the expectation that the student will complete a specified number of credit hours (or the equivalent) during that term. However, classes in a subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term, as is the case in a term-based calendar that is not subscription-based. For more detail on subscription-based programs, see Volume 2, Chapter 2. A subscription-based academic calendar consists of ""subscription periods"" that are either standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms (for guidance on when terms are considered to be substantially equal in length, see <Payment periods for programs using standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms= later in this chapter). Substantially equal nonstandard terms may be of any length, but if they are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for purposes of monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6 for more information on BBAY 3). Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length are not permissible in a subscription-based academic calendar. The term ""subscription period"" is synonymous with ""term"" and ""payment period"" (payment periods are covered later in this chapter). Except for the fact that classes are not required to start and end within a term, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs. These requirements include: minimum and maximum term length restrictions for standard terms (see the discussion in the next section of this chapter); requirements for determining full-time enrollment (see Volume 1, Chapter 1); use of a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY), BBAY 1, BBAY 2, or BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6); and use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards (see Volume 7, Chapter 4). Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. Standard Terms: Semesters, Trimesters, and Quarters Semesters and trimesters contain between 14 and 21 weeks of instructional time. However, a summer term in a program using semesters or trimesters may contain fewer than 14 weeks. An academic calendar that uses semesters or trimesters traditionally has three terms, one each in the fall, spring, and summer, two of which comprise an academic year. For example, in a program using an SAY calendar, fall and spring would comprise an academic year. In a program using a']","The Pell Grant award for students enrolled in subscription-based academic calendars is calculated using Pell Grant Formula 4, which is specifically used for non-term programs. The calculation considers the student's enrollment status, credit hours, and the time in school. Additionally, the Year-round Pell provision allows for extra funding if the student enrolls in summer sessions. The maximum Pell Grant award for the 2024-25 academic year is $7,395.

This may be due to constraints imposed by outside licensing bodies or the need to accommodate schedules of entities with which students are being placed (e.g., school districts or hospitals); and Credit hours associated with the practicum or clinical experience must be associated with the term in which most of the training occurs, even if the starting and ending dates do not exactly align with the term dates and/or overlap with another term. If the clinical work meets all the above criteria, terms which include such clinical work are not required to be considered nonstandard, nor are such programs required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. This flexibility is limited to required clinical periods associated with standard term programs in medicine (including, but not limited to, allopathic, osteopathic, nursing, veterinary, dentistry, pharmacy, and physical therapy), and student teaching required to obtain a state teaching certificate. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for additional guidance on certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets the criteria described above is included in a standard term. Nonstandard Terms Generally, nonstandard terms are terms that are not semesters, trimesters, or quarters. For example, a 5-week term or a 23-week term would be considered a nonstandard term because no standard term can be fewer than nine weeks or greater than 21 weeks in length. Like standard terms, nonstandard terms may be equal in length or may be of different lengths. If a program is offered in a combination of standard terms and nonstandard terms, the program is considered to be offered in nonstandard terms. Also, like standard terms, nonstandard terms may not overlap within a program. Even if a school calls its terms semesters, trimesters, or quarters, they are considered to be nonstandard terms if they do not comply with the policy on standard term length, as described earlier. For instance, a 22-week semester or an 8-week quarter must be treated as a nonstandard term, because a semester cannot contain more than 21 weeks and a quarter must include a minimum of nine weeks. Semesters, trimesters, or quarters are also considered to be nonstandard terms if academic progress is not measured in the manner normally associated with the type of term. For example, if a program is offered in 15-week semesters but measures academic progress in quarter credit hours, the semesters would be considered nonstandard terms.']","Veterinary clinical experiences are not included in standard term periods for financial aid purposes.

However, to receive a disbursement of Title IV aid for each subsequent subscription period in the program, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods in the program, excluding the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in the most recently attended subscription period. For more detailed guidance on the disbursement rules for subscription-based programs, including examples, refer to Appendix B at the end of this chapter. Multiple Disbursements Within a Payment Period The regulations governing the Title IV programs generally permit schools to pay Title IV funds at such times and in such installments within each payment period as will best meet students9 needs. This gives schools the ability to apportion the payment if doing so will be in the best interest of the student. For example, if a payment period is particularly long, a school might choose to pay in multiple installments to the extent program requirements permit to ensure that a student will have funds to pay rent later in the payment period. If a school chooses to schedule multiple Direct Loan disbursements within a single payment period, the disbursements must be substantially equal. Note also that if the loan period for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless the school qualifies for an exception to the multiple disbursement requirement. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more']","The disbursement timing rules for federal student aid differ between program types as follows:

1. **Clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs**:
   - Disbursements follow specific rules based on instructional time and program progress.
   - The first disbursement typically covers a portion of the program's progress, and the second disbursement covers the remaining progress or the completion of the program.
   - Disbursement is tied to the successful completion of certain instructional periods or program milestones.

2. **Subscription-based programs**:
   - Disbursements are based on a schedule aligned with academic terms or months.
   - For example, Direct Unsubsidized Loans are disbursed in monthly installments.
   - The timing depends on the program's academic calendar and specific disbursement policies, such as submitting the FAFSA by certain deadlines for priority processing.

In summary, clock-hour and non-term credit-hour programs have disbursements linked to instructional time and program milestones, while subscription-based programs disburse funds according to scheduled academic periods or monthly intervals.","In clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs, students must complete both the required credit or clock hours and the weeks of instructional time in a payment period before they can receive a disbursement of Pell Grant, FSEOG, TEACH Grant, or Direct Loan funds for the next payment period.

For the Direct Loan Program only, this same requirement applies to students who are enrolled in programs with nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length. Effect of Accelerated Progression on Disbursement Timing in a Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Program The Pell Grant or TEACH Grant amount that a student is eligible to receive for a payment period in a clock-hour or non- term credit-hour program is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods for the program that are established at the beginning of the program based on the program length (as described earlier in this chapter). These scheduled payment periods do not change, regardless of a student9s rate of progression through a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program. This means that if a student completes additional weeks of instructional time or hours while completing the other measure of a payment period, the actual number of weeks or hours that the student completes before a disbursement can be made for the next payment period may differ from the number of weeks or hours in the scheduled payment period used to determine the student9s grant amount for the payment period. Although a student9s completion of additional weeks or hours in a payment period has no effect on the scheduled payment periods for purposes of determining Pell Grant and TEACH Grant payment amounts, an undergraduate student who accelerates in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year of a program. Specifically, if a student enrolled in a program that is greater than one academic year in length completes additional clock or credit hours prior to the final academic year of the program, this may result in a final period of study that contains fewer clock or credit hours than the number of hours in the program9s defined academic year. In this circumstance, the Direct Loan annual loan limit for an undergraduate student must be prorated (reduced). The principles described above are illustrated by the examples in Appendix A at the end of this chapter. For guidance on calculating Pell Grant and TEACH Grant awards for clock-hour and non-term credit-hour programs, see Volume 7. For information on Direct Loan annual loan limit proration and annual loan limit progression in clock-hour and non-term credit- hour programs, see Volume 8, Chapters 5 and 6. If your school is unable to determine when a student has successfully completed half of the credit or clock hours in a program, academic year, or remainder of a program, the student is considered to have begun the second payment period of the program, academic year, or remainder of a program at the later of the date (identified by your school) that the student has successfully completed: half of the academic coursework in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program; or half of the number of weeks of instructional time in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program.', '<2-hop>\n\nDisbursement Timing in Subscription-Based Programs For the first two subscription periods (terms) that a student attends in a subscription-based program, there is no requirement for the student to have completed a certain amount of coursework before receiving a disbursement of Title IV funds (the same as in any other term-based program using credit hours). However, to receive a disbursement of Title IV aid for each subsequent subscription period in the program, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods in the program, excluding the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in the most recently attended subscription period. For more detailed guidance on the disbursement rules for subscription-based programs, including examples, refer to Appendix B at the end of this chapter. Multiple Disbursements Within a Payment Period The regulations governing the Title IV programs generally permit schools to pay Title IV funds at such times and in such installments within each payment period as will best meet students9 needs. This gives schools the ability to apportion the payment if doing so will be in the best interest of the student. For example, if a payment period is particularly long, a school might choose to pay in multiple installments to the extent program requirements permit to ensure that a student will have funds to pay rent later in the payment period. If a school chooses to schedule multiple Direct Loan disbursements within a single payment period, the disbursements must be substantially equal. Note also that if the loan period for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless the school qualifies for an exception to the multiple disbursement requirement. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more']","The disbursement timing requirements for federal student aid differ between clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs and subscription-based programs:

1. **Clock-hour or Non-term Credit-hour Programs:**
   - Disbursements are based on the successful completion of hours and weeks of instructional time in a payment period.
   - A student must complete the coursework associated with the hours in a payment period before receiving the next disbursement.
   - For programs without terms, the payment periods are defined by successful completion of clock hours and instructional weeks.
   - Disbursements are made after the student has completed the required hours and weeks in the current payment period.

2. **Subscription-based Programs:**
   - A school can make a disbursement of Title IV funds up to 10 days before the beginning of the subscription period for the first two terms.
   - Starting with the third subscription period, early disbursement (up to 10 days before the period begins) is only permitted if the student has completed the required credit hours for that period.
   - If the student has not completed the required coursework, disbursement is delayed until the coursework completion requirement is met.

In summary, clock-hour and non-term programs require students to complete specific hours and weeks before disbursement, whereas subscription-based programs allow early disbursement before the period begins, contingent on coursework completion starting from the third period onward.","In clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs, students must complete both the required credit or clock hours and weeks of instructional time in a payment period before receiving a disbursement of Pell Grant, FSEOG, TEACH Grant, or Direct Loan funds for the next payment period.

For clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs:
- Disbursements are typically prorated based on the number of credit or clock hours completed.
- Students must meet specific eligibility requirements, such as completing a certain number of credit hours (usually six) or clock hours (typically 225), before receiving subsequent disbursements.
- The disbursement process is tied to the payment periods, and students are generally required to have completed the payment period for which they have been paid before receiving additional funds.

For subscription-based programs:
- Disbursements usually occur in two payments through the school.
- The timing of these disbursements depends on the school's schedule, and students should check with their school's financial aid office for specific timing.
- Students must meet the standard eligibility requirements, but the disbursement process is less tied to specific hours completed and more to the school's disbursement schedule.
- Interest on loans, such as Direct Unsubsidized Loans, may accrue during deferment periods.

In summary, clock-hour and non-term programs have disbursements closely linked to hours completed and payment periods, requiring students to meet certain progress criteria before subsequent disbursements. Subscription-based programs follow a scheduled disbursement process set by the school, typically in two payments, with eligibility requirements generally consistent across programs.","In clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs, students must complete both the required credit or clock hours and the weeks of instructional time in a payment period before receiving a disbursement of Pell Grant, FSEOG, TEACH Grant, or Direct Loan funds for the next payment period.

**Standard Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Programs:**
- Students can receive disbursements without the need to have completed a specific amount of coursework in a payment period.
- There is no coursework completion requirement for subsequent disbursements.
- Disbursements are based on successful completion of clock or credit hours and weeks of instructional time.
- For example, a student can receive aid in a new payment period even if they did not pass courses in the previous period.

**Subscription-Based Programs:**
- For the first two subscription periods, students can receive disbursements up to 10 days before the start of each period without having completed coursework.
- Starting with the third subscription period, students must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total hours enrolled in all previous subscription periods (excluding the most recent one) before receiving a disbursement.
- This means that, unlike standard programs, students in subscription-based programs are required to meet coursework completion or cumulative credit hour requirements before being eligible for further disbursements.
- For programs with nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length, the disbursement rules follow non-term-based guidelines, requiring completion of a certain amount of coursework before subsequent disbursements.

For the Direct Loan Program only, this same requirement applies to students who are enrolled in programs with nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length. Effect of Accelerated Progression on Disbursement Timing in a Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Program The Pell Grant or TEACH Grant amount that a student is eligible to receive for a payment period in a clock-hour or non- term credit-hour program is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods for the program that are established at the beginning of the program based on the program length (as described earlier in this chapter). These scheduled payment periods do not change, regardless of a student9s rate of progression through a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program. This means that if a student completes additional weeks of instructional time or hours while completing the other measure of a payment period, the actual number of weeks or hours that the student completes before a disbursement can be made for the next payment period may differ from the number of weeks or hours in the scheduled payment period used to determine the student9s grant amount for the payment period. Although a student9s completion of additional weeks or hours in a payment period has no effect on the scheduled payment periods for purposes of determining Pell Grant and TEACH Grant payment amounts, an undergraduate student who accelerates in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year of a program. Specifically, if a student enrolled in a program that is greater than one academic year in length completes additional clock or credit hours prior to the final academic year of the program, this may result in a final period of study that contains fewer clock or credit hours than the number of hours in the program9s defined academic year. In this circumstance, the Direct Loan annual loan limit for an undergraduate student must be prorated (reduced). The principles described above are illustrated by the examples in Appendix A at the end of this chapter. For guidance on calculating Pell Grant and TEACH Grant awards for clock-hour and non-term credit-hour programs, see Volume 7. For information on Direct Loan annual loan limit proration and annual loan limit progression in clock-hour and non-term credit- hour programs, see Volume 8, Chapters 5 and 6. If your school is unable to determine when a student has successfully completed half of the credit or clock hours in a program, academic year, or remainder of a program, the student is considered to have begun the second payment period of the program, academic year, or remainder of a program at the later of the date (identified by your school) that the student has successfully completed: half of the academic coursework in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program; or half of the number of weeks of instructional time in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program.', '<2-hop>\n\nDisbursement Timing in Subscription-Based Programs For the first two subscription periods (terms) that a student attends in a subscription-based program, there is no requirement for the student to have completed a certain amount of coursework before receiving a disbursement of Title IV funds (the same as in any other term-based program using credit hours). However, to receive a disbursement of Title IV aid for each subsequent subscription period in the program, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods in the program, excluding the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in the most recently attended subscription period. For more detailed guidance on the disbursement rules for subscription-based programs, including examples, refer to Appendix B at the end of this chapter. Multiple Disbursements Within a Payment Period The regulations governing the Title IV programs generally permit schools to pay Title IV funds at such times and in such installments within each payment period as will best meet students9 needs. This gives schools the ability to apportion the payment if doing so will be in the best interest of the student. For example, if a payment period is particularly long, a school might choose to pay in multiple installments to the extent program requirements permit to ensure that a student will have funds to pay rent later in the payment period. If a school chooses to schedule multiple Direct Loan disbursements within a single payment period, the disbursements must be substantially equal. Note also that if the loan period for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless the school qualifies for an exception to the multiple disbursement requirement. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more']","The examples in Appendix A and Appendix B illustrate the differences in disbursement timing and eligibility requirements for students in clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs versus subscription-based programs as follows:

1. Appendix A (Clock-hour and Non-term Credit-hour Programs):
- Disbursement Timing: Disbursements depend on the successful completion of specific hours and weeks of instruction within defined payment periods. Students must complete all hours in a payment period before moving to the next.
- Eligibility Requirements: Students are eligible based on meeting the academic year weeks and hours of instruction, with disbursements tied to the successful completion of these hours and weeks.

2. Appendix B (Subscription-based Programs):
- Disbursement Timing: There is no initial coursework completion requirement for the first two subscription periods. For subsequent periods, disbursements depend on the student having completed a cumulative number of credit hours across all previous subscription periods, regardless of program version changes.
- Eligibility Requirements: Students must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours to qualify for disbursements in later subscription periods. The hours are counted across multiple subscription periods and are not reset when changing program versions.

In summary, clock-hour and non-term programs have strict disbursement timing based on completing all hours in a payment period, while subscription-based programs have a cumulative hours requirement that influences disbursement timing over multiple periods, with initial disbursements available without coursework completion.","The examples in Appendix A illustrate the principles of disbursement timing and eligibility for Pell Grant, TEACH Grant, and Direct Loan funds in clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs, including how accelerated progression can affect Direct Loan annual loan limit proration in the final academic year. In contrast, Appendix B provides detailed guidance and examples on the disbursement rules for subscription-based programs, specifically showing that while the first two subscription periods do not require completion of coursework before disbursement, subsequent periods require students to have completed a cumulative number of credit hours based on prior enrollment.

This may be due to constraints imposed by outside licensing bodies or the need to accommodate schedules of entities with which students are being placed (e.g., school districts or hospitals); and Credit hours associated with the practicum or clinical experience must be associated with the term in which most of the training occurs, even if the starting and ending dates do not exactly align with the term dates and/or overlap with another term. If the clinical work meets all the above criteria, terms which include such clinical work are not required to be considered nonstandard, nor are such programs required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. This flexibility is limited to required clinical periods associated with standard term programs in medicine (including, but not limited to, allopathic, osteopathic, nursing, veterinary, dentistry, pharmacy, and physical therapy), and student teaching required to obtain a state teaching certificate. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for additional guidance on certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets the criteria described above is included in a standard term. Nonstandard Terms Generally, nonstandard terms are terms that are not semesters, trimesters, or quarters. For example, a 5-week term or a 23-week term would be considered a nonstandard term because no standard term can be fewer than nine weeks or greater than 21 weeks in length. Like standard terms, nonstandard terms may be equal in length or may be of different lengths. If a program is offered in a combination of standard terms and nonstandard terms, the program is considered to be offered in nonstandard terms. Also, like standard terms, nonstandard terms may not overlap within a program. Even if a school calls its terms semesters, trimesters, or quarters, they are considered to be nonstandard terms if they do not comply with the policy on standard term length, as described earlier. For instance, a 22-week semester or an 8-week quarter must be treated as a nonstandard term, because a semester cannot contain more than 21 weeks and a quarter must include a minimum of nine weeks. Semesters, trimesters, or quarters are also considered to be nonstandard terms if academic progress is not measured in the manner normally associated with the type of term. For example, if a program is offered in 15-week semesters but measures academic progress in quarter credit hours, the semesters would be considered nonstandard terms.']","The disbursement timing rules for Title IV funds in subscription-based programs specify that funds are disbursed monthly.

In a standard term or nonstandard term academic calendar, a term is generally a period in which all classes are scheduled to begin and end within a set time frame, and academic progress is measured in credit hours. In a non-term academic calendar, classes do not begin and end within a set time frame, such as a term. Academic progress in a non-term program can be measured in either credit or clock hours. In some cases (as discussed below), a program with terms must be treated as a non-term program for Title IV purposes. A subscription-based academic calendar is used only by subscription-based programs. A subscription-based program is a term-based program in which the school charges a student for each term on a subscription basis with the expectation that the student will complete a specified number of credit hours (or the equivalent) during that term. However, classes in a subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term, as is the case in a term-based calendar that is not subscription-based. For more detail on subscription-based programs, see Volume 2, Chapter 2. A subscription-based academic calendar consists of ""subscription periods"" that are either standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms (for guidance on when terms are considered to be substantially equal in length, see <Payment periods for programs using standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms= later in this chapter). Substantially equal nonstandard terms may be of any length, but if they are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for purposes of monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6 for more information on BBAY 3). Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length are not permissible in a subscription-based academic calendar. The term ""subscription period"" is synonymous with ""term"" and ""payment period"" (payment periods are covered later in this chapter). Except for the fact that classes are not required to start and end within a term, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs. These requirements include: minimum and maximum term length restrictions for standard terms (see the discussion in the next section of this chapter); requirements for determining full-time enrollment (see Volume 1, Chapter 1); use of a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY), BBAY 1, BBAY 2, or BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6); and use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards (see Volume 7, Chapter 4). Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. Standard Terms: Semesters, Trimesters, and Quarters Semesters and trimesters contain between 14 and 21 weeks of instructional time. However, a summer term in a program using semesters or trimesters may contain fewer than 14 weeks. An academic calendar that uses semesters or trimesters traditionally has three terms, one each in the fall, spring, and summer, two of which comprise an academic year. For example, in a program using an SAY calendar, fall and spring would comprise an academic year.

Effect of Accelerated Progression on Disbursement Timing in a Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Program The Pell Grant or TEACH Grant amount that a student is eligible to receive for a payment period in a clock-hour or non- term credit-hour program is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods for the program that are established at the beginning of the program based on the program length (as described earlier in this chapter). These scheduled payment periods do not change, regardless of a student9s rate of progression through a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program.

Although a student9s completion of additional weeks or hours in a payment period has no effect on the scheduled payment periods for purposes of determining Pell Grant and TEACH Grant payment amounts, an undergraduate student who accelerates in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year of a program.

In this circumstance, the Direct Loan annual loan limit for an undergraduate student must be prorated (reduced).

In a non-term academic calendar, classes do not begin and end within a set time frame, such as a term. Academic progress in a non-term program can be measured in either credit or clock hours. In some cases (as discussed below), a program with terms must be treated as a non-term program for Title IV purposes. A subscription-based academic calendar is used only by subscription-based programs. A subscription-based program is a term-based program in which the school charges a student for each term on a subscription basis with the expectation that the student will complete a specified number of credit hours (or the equivalent) during that term. However, classes in a subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term, as is the case in a term-based calendar that is not subscription-based. For more detail on subscription-based programs, see Volume 2, Chapter 2. A subscription-based academic calendar consists of ""subscription periods"" that are either standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms (for guidance on when terms are considered to be substantially equal in length, see <Payment periods for programs using standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms= later in this chapter). Substantially equal nonstandard terms may be of any length, but if they are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for purposes of monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6 for more information on BBAY 3). Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length are not permissible in a subscription-based academic calendar. The term ""subscription period"" is synonymous with ""term"" and ""payment period"" (payment periods are covered later in this chapter). Except for the fact that classes are not required to start and end within a term, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs. These requirements include: minimum and maximum term length restrictions for standard terms (see the discussion in the next section of this chapter); requirements for determining full-time enrollment (see Volume 1, Chapter 1); use of a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY), BBAY 1, BBAY 2, or BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6); and use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards (see Volume 7, Chapter 4). Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. Standard Terms: Semesters, Trimesters, and Quarters Semesters and trimesters contain between 14 and 21 weeks of instructional time. However, a summer term in a program using semesters or trimesters may contain fewer than 14 weeks. An academic calendar that uses semesters or trimesters traditionally has three terms, one each in the fall, spring, and summer, two of which comprise an academic year. For example, in a program using an SAY calendar, fall and spring would comprise an academic year. In a program using a']","The requirements for Pell Grant disbursement and calculation differ between clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs and subscription-based academic calendars. 

For clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs:
- Pell Grants are calculated based on a Base Year Award Year (BBAY) and follow Formula 4.
- A minimum 30-week academic year is required.
- Students must demonstrate satisfactory academic progress.
- Disbursement is aligned with the academic year and credit-hour accumulation.

For subscription-based academic calendars:
- Pell Grant disbursement follows the specific academic calendar schedule of the institution.
- Detailed requirements for these programs are not explicitly specified on the federal website.
- It is recommended to consult the college's financial aid office for precise disbursement procedures.

Implications for payment periods and academic progress measurement:
- Clock-hour/non-term programs typically have defined payment periods based on credit-hour accumulation and a set academic year length.
- Subscription-based calendars may have flexible or rolling payment periods aligned with the institution's schedule.
- Academic progress is measured according to the program's structure, with clock-hour programs requiring progress within a 30-week minimum, while subscription-based programs depend on the specific calendar.

Overall, the key difference lies in the structure of the academic calendar and how disbursement and progress are tracked, affecting the timing and method of Pell Grant payments.","In clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs, Pell Grant disbursement is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods established at the beginning of the program. These scheduled payment periods do not change regardless of a student's rate of progression, meaning that even if a student completes additional weeks or hours, the payment periods used to determine Pell Grant amounts remain fixed. Academic progress in these programs is measured by the completion of credit or clock hours and weeks of instructional time, and disbursement for the next payment period cannot occur until both measures are met. In contrast, subscription-based academic calendars are term-based but do not require classes to begin or end within a specific timeframe for each term. Instead, students are charged on a subscription basis with the expectation of completing a specified number of credit hours per term. Payment periods in subscription-based programs are synonymous with 'subscription periods' or 'terms,' and Pell Grant awards are calculated using Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3, depending on the program structure. The type of academic calendar—whether standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based—affects how aid is awarded and disbursed, as well as how academic progress is measured for Title IV purposes.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer,"[None, 'StudentAid_Federal_Search']",10
