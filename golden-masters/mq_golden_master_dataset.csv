In a standard term or nonstandard term academic calendar, a term is generally a period in which all classes are scheduled to begin and end within a set time frame, and academic progress is measured in credit hours. In a non-term academic calendar, classes do not begin and end within a set time frame, such as a term. Academic progress in a non-term program can be measured in either credit or clock hours. In some cases (as discussed below), a program with terms must be treated as a non-term program for Title IV purposes. A subscription-based academic calendar is used only by subscription-based programs. A subscription-based program is a term-based program in which the school charges a student for each term on a subscription basis with the expectation that the student will complete a specified number of credit hours (or the equivalent) during that term. However, classes in a subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term, as is the case in a term-based calendar that is not subscription-based. For more detail on subscription-based programs, see Volume 2, Chapter 2. A subscription-based academic calendar consists of ""subscription periods"" that are either standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms (for guidance on when terms are considered to be substantially equal in length, see <Payment periods for programs using standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms= later in this chapter). Substantially equal nonstandard terms may be of any length, but if they are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for purposes of monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6 for more information on BBAY 3). Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length are not permissible in a subscription-based academic calendar. The term ""subscription period"" is synonymous with ""term"" and ""payment period"" (payment periods are covered later in this chapter). Except for the fact that classes are not required to start and end within a term, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs. These requirements include: minimum and maximum term length restrictions for standard terms (see the discussion in the next section of this chapter); requirements for determining full-time enrollment (see Volume 1, Chapter 1); use of a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY), BBAY 1, BBAY 2, or BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6); and use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards (see Volume 7, Chapter 4). Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. Standard Terms: Semesters, Trimesters, and Quarters Semesters and trimesters contain between 14 and 21 weeks of instructional time. However, a summer term in a program using semesters or trimesters may contain fewer than 14 weeks. An academic calendar that uses semesters or trimesters traditionally has three terms, one each in the fall, spring, and summer, two of which comprise an academic year. For example, in a program using an SAY calendar, fall and spring would comprise an academic year. In a program using a']","The structure of an academic calendar, such as standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based, influences how Pell Grant awards are calculated and disbursed. 

- For **standard term programs**, Pell Grants are typically disbursed in accordance with the institution's academic calendar, often on a semester or quarter basis, aligning with the traditional academic schedule.
- For **nonstandard term programs**, which may have irregular or shorter terms, the disbursement process may differ. The Department of Education may treat these programs differently if they do not conform to traditional academic calendars, potentially affecting the timing and amount of disbursements.
- **Non-term or subscription-based programs** may have unique disbursement schedules, often requiring special considerations to ensure that Pell Grant funds are allocated appropriately based on the student's enrollment periods.

Overall, the disbursement of Pell Grants is closely tied to the institution's academic calendar structure, with adjustments made for nonstandard or non-term formats to ensure proper allocation of funds.","The structure of an academic calendar—whether it is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based—affects how Pell Grant awards are calculated and disbursed. In subscription-based programs, which are term-based but do not require classes to start and end within a specific timeframe, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply. This includes the use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards. The type of academic calendar determines the applicable Pell Grant formula and the timing of aid disbursement under Title IV programs.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
"medicine program clinical work, it gotta be in standard term or not?",[],"['Inclusion of Clinical Work in a Standard Term Periods of medical and education program clinical work which is conducted outside the classroom may not be included in a standard term, unless all of the following apply: All students in the program must participate in the practicum or clinical experience, and they must be required to complete the practicum or clinical experience as a condition for applying for licensure or authorization to practice the occupation they intend to pursue; The school has little or no control over the length or starting and ending dates of the practicum or clinical experience. This may be due to constraints imposed by outside licensing bodies or the need to accommodate schedules of entities with which students are being placed (e.g., school districts or hospitals); and Credit hours associated with the practicum or clinical experience must be associated with the term in which most of the training occurs, even if the starting and ending dates do not exactly align with the term dates and/or overlap with another term. If the clinical work meets all the above criteria, terms which include such clinical work are not required to be considered nonstandard, nor are such programs required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. This flexibility is limited to required clinical periods associated with standard term programs in medicine (including, but not limited to, allopathic, osteopathic, nursing, veterinary, dentistry, pharmacy, and physical therapy), and student teaching required to obtain a state teaching certificate. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for additional guidance on certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets the criteria described above is included in a standard term. Nonstandard Terms Generally, nonstandard terms are terms that are not semesters, trimesters, or quarters. For example, a 5-week term or a 23-week term would be considered a nonstandard term because no standard term can be fewer than nine weeks or greater than 21 weeks in length. Like standard terms, nonstandard terms may be equal in length or may be of different lengths. If a program is offered in a combination of standard terms and nonstandard terms, the program is considered to be offered in nonstandard terms. Also, like standard terms, nonstandard terms may not overlap within a program. Even if a school calls its terms semesters, trimesters, or quarters, they are considered to be nonstandard terms if they do not comply with the policy on standard term length, as described earlier. For instance, a 22-week semester or an 8-week quarter must be treated as a nonstandard term, because a semester cannot contain more than 21 weeks and a quarter must include a minimum of nine weeks. Semesters, trimesters, or quarters are also considered to be nonstandard terms if academic progress is not measured in the manner normally associated with the type of term. For example, if a program is offered in 15-week semesters but measures academic progress in quarter credit hours, the semesters would be considered nonstandard terms.']",Could you please clarify your question a bit more? Are you asking whether clinical work in a medicine program needs to be documented or described using standard medical terminology? Or are you referring to something else related to medicine programs and clinical work? Providing more details will help me give you a more accurate answer.,"If the clinical work in a medicine program meets all the criteria listed—like all students must do it, it's required for licensure, the school don't control the dates, and the credit hours go with the term where most training happens—then terms with that clinical work don't gotta be considered nonstandard, even if the clinical work overlaps another term.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer

"so like if a student gettin a TEACH Grant in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program, and they finish more weeks or hours than scheduled in a payment period, does that change how much TEACH Grant they get or when they get the next disbursement, or what happen if they go faster than normal?",[],"['both the credit or clock hours and the weeks of instructional time in a payment period before receiving a disbursement of Pell Grant, FSEOG, TEACH Grant or Direct Loan funds for the next payment period. For the Direct Loan Program only, this same requirement applies to students who are enrolled in programs with nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length. Effect of Accelerated Progression on Disbursement Timing in a Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Program The Pell Grant or TEACH Grant amount that a student is eligible to receive for a payment period in a clock-hour or non- term credit-hour program is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods for the program that are established at the beginning of the program based on the program length (as described earlier in this chapter). These scheduled payment periods do not change, regardless of a student9s rate of progression through a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program. This means that if a student completes additional weeks of instructional time or hours while completing the other measure of a payment period, the actual number of weeks or hours that the student completes before a disbursement can be made for the next payment period may differ from the number of weeks or hours in the scheduled payment period used to determine the student9s grant amount for the payment period. Although a student9s completion of additional weeks or hours in a payment period has no effect on the scheduled payment periods for purposes of determining Pell Grant and TEACH Grant payment amounts, an undergraduate student who accelerates in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year of a program. Specifically, if a student enrolled in a program that is greater than one academic year in length completes additional clock or credit hours prior to the final academic year of the program, this may result in a final period of study that contains fewer clock or credit hours than the number of hours in the program9s defined academic year. In this circumstance, the Direct Loan annual loan limit for an undergraduate student must be prorated (reduced). The principles described above are illustrated by the examples in Appendix A at the end of this chapter. For guidance on calculating Pell Grant and TEACH Grant awards for clock-hour and non-term credit-hour programs, see Volume 7. For information on Direct Loan annual loan limit proration and annual loan limit progression in clock-hour and non-term credit- hour programs, see Volume 8, Chapters 5 and 6. If your school is unable to determine when a student has successfully completed half of the credit or clock hours in a program, academic year, or remainder of a program, the student is considered to have begun the second payment period of the program, academic year, or remainder of a program at the later of the date (identified by your school) that the student has successfully completed: half of the academic coursework in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program; or half of the number of weeks of instructional time in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program.']","If a student receiving a TEACH Grant in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program completes more weeks or hours than scheduled in a payment period, it does not affect the scheduled payment periods or the amount of TEACH Grant they are eligible to receive. However, completing additional weeks or hours may impact the timing of disbursements. Specifically, the student may experience a delay in receiving the next disbursement until they have completed the required number of hours or weeks for the next scheduled payment period.

If the student progresses faster than normal by completing more hours or weeks earlier than scheduled, the scheduled payment periods remain unchanged. This means that the actual disbursement of funds for the next payment period may be delayed until the student completes the necessary hours or weeks for that period. In essence, completing more hours or weeks than scheduled does not increase the grant amount or accelerate disbursements; it may only cause the disbursement to occur later, once the scheduled requirements are met.","if a student gettin a TEACH Grant in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program finishes more weeks or hours than scheduled in a payment period, it don’t change the scheduled payment periods used to figure out the TEACH Grant amount for that period. the scheduled payment periods stay the same no matter how fast the student goes, so the grant amount don’t change. but the actual number of weeks or hours the student completes before gettin the next disbursement might be different from the scheduled amount. so, goin faster don’t affect the TEACH Grant payment amount, just when the next disbursement can happen.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer

If a school chooses to schedule multiple Direct Loan disbursements within a single payment period, the disbursements must be substantially equal.

For clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs:
- Disbursements are based on completing specific portions of the program.
- The first disbursement is made after the student completes half of the program's clock hours and weeks of instructional time for the initial period.
- Subsequent disbursements are made after the student completes the remaining half.
- For programs longer than one academic year, the first disbursement covers half of the academic year's clock hours and weeks, with the second covering the full year.

For subscription-based programs:
- Disbursement timing varies by program.
- Students should contact their school's financial aid office for specific details.
- Loan transfers and updates are reflected on StudentAid.gov within 7–10 business days.
- Students can check the status of their FAFSA and disbursements online or through their school's financial aid office.

Regarding the specific requirements before students can receive subsequent disbursements:

In clock-hour or non-term programs:
- Students must complete the required portion of the program (half the clock hours and weeks for the initial disbursement, and the remaining half for subsequent disbursements).

In subscription-based programs:
- Students need to meet the program-specific disbursement criteria set by their institution, which typically involves maintaining satisfactory academic progress and meeting any other eligibility requirements.

This may be due to constraints imposed by outside licensing bodies or the need to accommodate schedules of entities with which students are being placed (e.g., school districts or hospitals); and Credit hours associated with the practicum or clinical experience must be associated with the term in which most of the training occurs, even if the starting and ending dates do not exactly align with the term dates and/or overlap with another term. If the clinical work meets all the above criteria, terms which include such clinical work are not required to be considered nonstandard, nor are such programs required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. This flexibility is limited to required clinical periods associated with standard term programs in medicine (including, but not limited to, allopathic, osteopathic, nursing, veterinary, dentistry, pharmacy, and physical therapy), and student teaching required to obtain a state teaching certificate. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for additional guidance on certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets the criteria described above is included in a standard term. Nonstandard Terms Generally, nonstandard terms are terms that are not semesters, trimesters, or quarters. For example, a 5-week term or a 23-week term would be considered a nonstandard term because no standard term can be fewer than nine weeks or greater than 21 weeks in length. Like standard terms, nonstandard terms may be equal in length or may be of different lengths. If a program is offered in a combination of standard terms and nonstandard terms, the program is considered to be offered in nonstandard terms. Also, like standard terms, nonstandard terms may not overlap within a program. Even if a school calls its terms semesters, trimesters, or quarters, they are considered to be nonstandard terms if they do not comply with the policy on standard term length, as described earlier. For instance, a 22-week semester or an 8-week quarter must be treated as a nonstandard term, because a semester cannot contain more than 21 weeks and a quarter must include a minimum of nine weeks. Semesters, trimesters, or quarters are also considered to be nonstandard terms if academic progress is not measured in the manner normally associated with the type of term. For example, if a program is offered in 15-week semesters but measures academic progress in quarter credit hours, the semesters would be considered nonstandard terms.', '<2-hop>\n\nNon-Term Characteristics A program that measures progress in clock hours is always treated as a non-term program. Except for subscription-based programs, a program that measures progress in credit-hours is considered to have a non- term calendar if it has: Courses that do not begin and end within a set period of time such as a term; Courses that overlap terms; Self-paced and independent study courses that overlap terms; or Sequential courses that do not begin and end within a term. Payment Periods The payment period is applicable to all Title IV programs except the Federal Work-Study (FWS) Program. For example, Title IV program disbursements (except FWS payments) must be made on a payment period basis, as discussed in detail']","A practicum or clinical experience required for licensure can be included in a standard term if the following conditions are met:

1. All students in the program must participate in the practicum or clinical experience, and it must be a requirement for applying for licensure or authorization to practice the occupation.
2. The school has little or no control over the length or start and end dates of the practicum or clinical experience, often due to outside licensing bodies or scheduling constraints of placement entities.
3. The credit hours associated with the practicum or clinical experience must be associated with the term in which most of the training occurs, even if the actual start and end dates do not exactly align with the term dates or overlap with another term.
4. The clinical work must include a minimum of nine weeks in medicine programs (including, but not limited to, allopathic, osteopathic, nursing, veterinary, dentistry, pharmacy, and physical therapy).

If these conditions are satisfied, the clinical work can be included within a standard term, and the program is not required to be considered nonstandard or non-term, even if the clinical experience overlaps another term.

In contrast, non-term programs are characterized by:

- Measuring progress in clock hours rather than credit hours.
- Having courses that do not begin and end within a set period of time.
- Having courses that overlap terms.
- Not adhering to a fixed schedule of start and end dates for courses.
- Being considered nonstandard if they do not follow the typical semester, trimester, or quarter structure, or if they are subscription-based or module-based programs.

The key difference is that clinical experiences meeting the specified criteria can be integrated into a standard term, whereas non-term programs generally do not follow fixed scheduling and measure progress differently.","A practicum or clinical experience required for licensure in a medical or education program can be included in a standard term if all students must participate in it as a condition for licensure, the school has little or no control over its length or dates (often due to external licensing bodies or placement schedules), and the credit hours are associated with the term in which most training occurs, even if the dates do not align exactly with the term or overlap another term. If these criteria are met, the program is not required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. In contrast, non-term programs are defined by characteristics such as measuring progress in clock hours, having courses that do not begin and end within a set term, courses that overlap terms, or self-paced and independent study courses.

"How do the disbursement timing requirements for federal student aid differ between clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs and subscription-based programs, particularly regarding the completion of coursework or credit hours before receiving subsequent disbursements, and what flexibility do schools have in scheduling multiple disbursements within a payment period?",[],"['<1-hop>\n\nboth the credit or clock hours and the weeks of instructional time in a payment period before receiving a disbursement of Pell Grant, FSEOG, TEACH Grant or Direct Loan funds for the next payment period. For the Direct Loan Program only, this same requirement applies to students who are enrolled in programs with nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length. Effect of Accelerated Progression on Disbursement Timing in a Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Program The Pell Grant or TEACH Grant amount that a student is eligible to receive for a payment period in a clock-hour or non- term credit-hour program is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods for the program that are established at the beginning of the program based on the program length (as described earlier in this chapter). These scheduled payment periods do not change, regardless of a student9s rate of progression through a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program. This means that if a student completes additional weeks of instructional time or hours while completing the other measure of a payment period, the actual number of weeks or hours that the student completes before a disbursement can be made for the next payment period may differ from the number of weeks or hours in the scheduled payment period used to determine the student9s grant amount for the payment period. Although a student9s completion of additional weeks or hours in a payment period has no effect on the scheduled payment periods for purposes of determining Pell Grant and TEACH Grant payment amounts, an undergraduate student who accelerates in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year of a program. Specifically, if a student enrolled in a program that is greater than one academic year in length completes additional clock or credit hours prior to the final academic year of the program, this may result in a final period of study that contains fewer clock or credit hours than the number of hours in the program9s defined academic year. In this circumstance, the Direct Loan annual loan limit for an undergraduate student must be prorated (reduced). The principles described above are illustrated by the examples in Appendix A at the end of this chapter. For guidance on calculating Pell Grant and TEACH Grant awards for clock-hour and non-term credit-hour programs, see Volume 7. For information on Direct Loan annual loan limit proration and annual loan limit progression in clock-hour and non-term credit- hour programs, see Volume 8, Chapters 5 and 6. If your school is unable to determine when a student has successfully completed half of the credit or clock hours in a program, academic year, or remainder of a program, the student is considered to have begun the second payment period of the program, academic year, or remainder of a program at the later of the date (identified by your school) that the student has successfully completed: half of the academic coursework in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program; or half of the number of weeks of instructional time in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program.', '<2-hop>\n\nDisbursement Timing in Subscription-Based Programs For the first two subscription periods (terms) that a student attends in a subscription-based program, there is no requirement for the student to have completed a certain amount of coursework before receiving a disbursement of Title IV funds (the same as in any other term-based program using credit hours). However, to receive a disbursement of Title IV aid for each subsequent subscription period in the program, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods in the program, excluding the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in the most recently attended subscription period. For more detailed guidance on the disbursement rules for subscription-based programs, including examples, refer to Appendix B at the end of this chapter. Multiple Disbursements Within a Payment Period The regulations governing the Title IV programs generally permit schools to pay Title IV funds at such times and in such installments within each payment period as will best meet students9 needs. This gives schools the ability to apportion the payment if doing so will be in the best interest of the student. For example, if a payment period is particularly long, a school might choose to pay in multiple installments to the extent program requirements permit to ensure that a student will have funds to pay rent later in the payment period. If a school chooses to schedule multiple Direct Loan disbursements within a single payment period, the disbursements must be substantially equal. Note also that if the loan period for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless the school qualifies for an exception to the multiple disbursement requirement. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more']","The disbursement timing requirements for federal student aid differ between clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs and subscription-based programs as follows:

**Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Programs:**
- Students must successfully complete the required clock hours or credit hours and weeks of instructional time in a payment period before receiving the next disbursement.
- Disbursements are contingent upon coursework passing associated with those hours.
- For programs with nonstandard terms not substantially equal in length, the same requirements apply.
- The second disbursement may not be made until the student has completed half of the instructional time and hours in the payment period, unless exceptions apply.

**Subscription-Based Programs:**
- For the first two subscription periods, schools can disburse funds up to 10 days before the start of each period, regardless of coursework completion.
- Starting with the third subscription period, disbursements require the student to have completed the required coursework (credit hours) for that period.
- For subsequent periods, students must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total hours for all previously attended subscription periods (excluding the most recent period) before receiving a disbursement.
- There is no coursework completion requirement for the first two periods, but from the third period onward, coursework completion is necessary.

Regarding flexibility in scheduling multiple disbursements within a payment period:
- Schools have the discretion to schedule multiple disbursements at times that best meet students' needs.
- They can apportion payments, especially for long payment periods, to ensure students have funds later in the period.
- Disbursements can be made in multiple installments, provided they are substantially equal if the loan period is a single payment period.
- If more than half of the payment period has elapsed before the disbursement, the entire period's loan proceeds can be included in that disbursement.
- Schools may also establish policies to recalculate awards if students' costs change during a payment period.

The scheduled payment periods are established at the beginning of the program and do not change based on a student's rate of progression. If a student accelerates and completes additional weeks or hours, this does not affect the scheduled payment periods for Pell Grant and TEACH Grant amounts, but may result in reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year if the last period contains fewer hours than the defined academic year, requiring proration of the loan limit.

1. Classification of Terms:
- If clinical work meets the criteria described in Volume 3 for inclusion in a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term, the school must associate the clinical work with the term during which the majority of the clinical work occurs.
- When clinical work is included in a standard or substantially equal nonstandard term that contains clinical work meeting all criteria, certain exceptions to normal loan period and disbursement rules apply.

2. Disbursement Timing Rules:
- If clinical work begins before the official start date of the associated term, the loan period start date is the beginning date of the clinical work, not the term.
- For second or subsequent disbursements in a loan period that includes clinical work not yet started at the beginning of the term, the disbursement can be made no earlier than 10 days before the start of the clinical work.
- If a standard or SE9W nonstandard term contains clinical work that meets all inclusion criteria, certain exceptions allow for earlier disbursements aligned with the clinical work's start date rather than the term's start date.

In summary, including clinical work in a standard term can lead to earlier disbursements, especially when the clinical work starts before the official term start date, by aligning disbursement timing with the clinical work's commencement.","Volume 8, Chapter 3 explains that clinical work in standard term programs may be included in a standard term if all students are required to participate as a condition for licensure, the school has little or no control over the practicum’s timing, and credit hours are associated with the term in which most training occurs.

In a standard term or nonstandard term academic calendar, a term is generally a period in which all classes are scheduled to begin and end within a set time frame, and academic progress is measured in credit hours. In a non-term academic calendar, classes do not begin and end within a set time frame, such as a term. Academic progress in a non-term program can be measured in either credit or clock hours. In some cases (as discussed below), a program with terms must be treated as a non-term program for Title IV purposes. A subscription-based academic calendar is used only by subscription-based programs. A subscription-based program is a term-based program in which the school charges a student for each term on a subscription basis with the expectation that the student will complete a specified number of credit hours (or the equivalent) during that term. However, classes in a subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term, as is the case in a term-based calendar that is not subscription-based. For more detail on subscription-based programs, see Volume 2, Chapter 2. A subscription-based academic calendar consists of ""subscription periods"" that are either standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms (for guidance on when terms are considered to be substantially equal in length, see <Payment periods for programs using standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms= later in this chapter). Substantially equal nonstandard terms may be of any length, but if they are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for purposes of monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6 for more information on BBAY 3). Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length are not permissible in a subscription-based academic calendar. The term ""subscription period"" is synonymous with ""term"" and ""payment period"" (payment periods are covered later in this chapter). Except for the fact that classes are not required to start and end within a term, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs. These requirements include: minimum and maximum term length restrictions for standard terms (see the discussion in the next section of this chapter); requirements for determining full-time enrollment (see Volume 1, Chapter 1); use of a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY), BBAY 1, BBAY 2, or BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6); and use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards (see Volume 7, Chapter 4). Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. Standard Terms: Semesters, Trimesters, and Quarters Semesters and trimesters contain between 14 and 21 weeks of instructional time. However, a summer term in a program using semesters or trimesters may contain fewer than 14 weeks. An academic calendar that uses semesters or trimesters traditionally has three terms, one each in the fall, spring, and summer, two of which comprise an academic year. For example, in a program using an SAY calendar, fall and spring would comprise an academic year. In a program using a']","The structure of non-term and subscription-based academic calendars significantly influences the calculation and disbursement of Pell Grant awards in clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs. 

For non-term programs, the student's Pell award is not automatically reduced for part-time enrollment unless the student is enrolled less than half-time, in which case the Cost of Attendance (COA) must be adjusted. The timing of disbursements and the calculation of award amounts depend on the specific payment periods, which are determined based on the program's instructional time and hours, as well as the academic calendar structure.

When the academic calendar is non-standard or non-term, the number of weeks and hours in each payment period may differ from the standard academic year. This requires prorating Pell costs to accurately reflect the student's scheduled instructional time. For example, if a program offers fewer weeks of instruction or fewer credit hours than the typical academic year, the Pell award must be adjusted proportionally to account for these differences.

In subscription-based programs, the same general rules for credit or clock hours and instructional time apply, but the specific calculation methods may differ as outlined in Volume 3. The structure of the academic calendar affects the determination of payment periods, the timing of disbursements, and the calculation of the award amount, ensuring that funds are distributed in accordance with the actual instructional time and program length.

Overall, non-term and subscription-based calendars, by deviating from standard academic year structures, necessitate prorated calculations and tailored disbursement schedules to accurately reflect the student's enrollment and instructional time, thereby affecting the timing and amount of Pell Grant awards.","The structure of non-term and subscription-based academic calendars directly impacts the calculation and disbursement of Pell Grant awards in clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs. In non-term academic calendars, classes do not begin and end within a set timeframe, and academic progress can be measured in either credit or clock hours. For Pell Grant awards in these programs, the amount a student is eligible to receive for a payment period is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods established at the beginning of the program. These scheduled payment periods do not change, regardless of a student’s rate of progression. In subscription-based programs, which are a type of term-based program, Pell Grant awards are calculated using Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3, and the term 'subscription period' is synonymous with 'term' and 'payment period.' The rules for term-based programs also apply to subscription-based programs, including requirements for determining full-time enrollment and the use of specific academic year structures. Therefore, the academic calendar type determines both the method for calculating Pell Grant awards and the timing of disbursements under Title IV regulations.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
"According to Volume 8, Chapter 6 and Volume 8, Chapter 3, how do the requirements for disbursement timing and academic progress in subscription-based programs differ from those in standard term or non-term academic calendars, particularly regarding the use of subscription periods, BBAY 3, and multiple disbursements within a payment period?",[],"['<1-hop>\n\nDisbursement Timing in Subscription-Based Programs For the first two subscription periods (terms) that a student attends in a subscription-based program, there is no requirement for the student to have completed a certain amount of coursework before receiving a disbursement of Title IV funds (the same as in any other term-based program using credit hours). However, to receive a disbursement of Title IV aid for each subsequent subscription period in the program, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods in the program, excluding the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in the most recently attended subscription period. For more detailed guidance on the disbursement rules for subscription-based programs, including examples, refer to Appendix B at the end of this chapter. Multiple Disbursements Within a Payment Period The regulations governing the Title IV programs generally permit schools to pay Title IV funds at such times and in such installments within each payment period as will best meet students9 needs. This gives schools the ability to apportion the payment if doing so will be in the best interest of the student. For example, if a payment period is particularly long, a school might choose to pay in multiple installments to the extent program requirements permit to ensure that a student will have funds to pay rent later in the payment period. If a school chooses to schedule multiple Direct Loan disbursements within a single payment period, the disbursements must be substantially equal. Note also that if the loan period for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless the school qualifies for an exception to the multiple disbursement requirement. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more', '<2-hop>\n\nnon-term (includes clock-hour calendars), or subscription-based. In a standard term or nonstandard term academic calendar, a term is generally a period in which all classes are scheduled to begin and end within a set time frame, and academic progress is measured in credit hours. In a non-term academic calendar, classes do not begin and end within a set time frame, such as a term. Academic progress in a non-term program can be measured in either credit or clock hours. In some cases (as discussed below), a program with terms must be treated as a non-term program for Title IV purposes. A subscription-based academic calendar is used only by subscription-based programs. A subscription-based program is a term-based program in which the school charges a student for each term on a subscription basis with the expectation that the student will complete a specified number of credit hours (or the equivalent) during that term. However, classes in a subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term, as is the case in a term-based calendar that is not subscription-based. For more detail on subscription-based programs, see Volume 2, Chapter 2. A subscription-based academic calendar consists of ""subscription periods"" that are either standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms (for guidance on when terms are considered to be substantially equal in length, see <Payment periods for programs using standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms= later in this chapter). Substantially equal nonstandard terms may be of any length, but if they are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for purposes of monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6 for more information on BBAY 3). Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length are not permissible in a subscription-based academic calendar. The term ""subscription period"" is synonymous with ""term"" and ""payment period"" (payment periods are covered later in this chapter). Except for the fact that classes are not required to start and end within a term, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs. These requirements include: minimum and maximum term length restrictions for standard terms (see the discussion in the next section of this chapter); requirements for determining full-time enrollment (see Volume 1, Chapter 1); use of a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY), BBAY 1, BBAY 2, or BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6); and use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards (see Volume 7, Chapter 4). Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. Standard Terms: Semesters, Trimesters, and Quarters Semesters and trimesters contain between 14 and 21 weeks of instructional time. However, a summer term in a program using semesters or trimesters may contain fewer than 14 weeks. An academic calendar that uses semesters or trimesters traditionally has three terms, one each in the fall, spring, and summer, two of which comprise an academic year. For example, in a program using an SAY calendar, fall and spring would comprise an academic year. In a program using a']","According to the information from Volume 8, Chapters 6 and 3, the requirements for disbursement timing and academic progress in subscription-based programs differ from those in standard term or non-term academic calendars in several ways:

1. Disbursement Timing Without Initial Coursework Completion:
- Subscription-based programs do not require students to complete a specific amount of coursework before the first two subscription periods' disbursements.
- For subsequent periods, disbursements depend on the student having completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total hours enrolled in all previous subscription periods, excluding hours for which the student was not enrolled.

2. Use of Subscription Periods and Cumulative Credit Hours:
- Disbursement eligibility is tied to the student's cumulative credit hours across subscription periods.
- For example, to receive disbursement in subscription period 4, the student must have completed the total hours enrolled in subscription periods 1 and 2.

3. Monitoring Using BBAY 3 and Subscription Periods:
- BBAY 3 is used for clock-hour or non-standard programs, especially when terms are not substantially equal or are non-standard.
- Subscription periods serve as the basis for disbursement timing, with specific credit hour or course completion requirements at each period based on cumulative hours.

4. Multiple Disbursements Within a Payment Period:
- Multiple disbursements can occur within a single subscription period, provided the student meets the cumulative credit hour requirements at each disbursement point.
- Disbursements are delayed if the student has not yet met the cumulative progress requirements.

5. Differences from Standard Term or Non-Term Calendars:
- Standard or non-standard term programs typically tie disbursements to course completion at the start of each term, with less emphasis on cumulative hours.
- The subscription model emphasizes flexible, progress-based disbursements, allowing multiple disbursements within a payment period and not requiring students to complete a set amount of coursework before the first disbursement.

In summary, subscription-based programs use a cumulative credit hour approach, monitored via subscription periods and BBAYs, allowing for multiple disbursements within a payment period based on the student's progress, contrasting with the more rigid timing and progress criteria of standard calendars.","In subscription-based programs, as described in Volume 8, Chapter 6 and referenced in Volume 8, Chapter 3, the disbursement timing for Title IV aid differs from standard term or non-term academic calendars. For the first two subscription periods, students are not required to complete a certain amount of coursework before receiving Title IV funds, similar to other term-based programs using credit hours. However, for subsequent subscription periods, students must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods, excluding the most recent one, to receive further disbursements. Subscription-based programs use 'subscription periods,' which are synonymous with 'terms' or 'payment periods,' and these can be standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms. If nonstandard terms are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression. Additionally, schools may choose to make multiple disbursements within a payment period, but if they do so for Direct Loans, the disbursements must be substantially equal, and if the loan period is a single payment period, at least two installments are required unless an exception applies. These requirements ensure that aid is awarded and disbursed in accordance with the unique structure of subscription-based programs, as opposed to the more rigid timing and progress requirements in standard term or non-term calendars.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
