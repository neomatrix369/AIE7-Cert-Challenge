In a standard term or nonstandard term academic calendar, a term is generally a period in which all classes are scheduled to begin and end within a set time frame, and academic progress is measured in credit hours. In a non-term academic calendar, classes do not begin and end within a set time frame, such as a term. Academic progress in a non-term program can be measured in either credit or clock hours. In some cases (as discussed below), a program with terms must be treated as a non-term program for Title IV purposes. A subscription-based academic calendar is used only by subscription-based programs. A subscription-based program is a term-based program in which the school charges a student for each term on a subscription basis with the expectation that the student will complete a specified number of credit hours (or the equivalent) during that term. However, classes in a subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term, as is the case in a term-based calendar that is not subscription-based. For more detail on subscription-based programs, see Volume 2, Chapter 2. A subscription-based academic calendar consists of ""subscription periods"" that are either standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms (for guidance on when terms are considered to be substantially equal in length, see <Payment periods for programs using standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms= later in this chapter). Substantially equal nonstandard terms may be of any length, but if they are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for purposes of monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6 for more information on BBAY 3). Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length are not permissible in a subscription-based academic calendar. The term ""subscription period"" is synonymous with ""term"" and ""payment period"" (payment periods are covered later in this chapter). Except for the fact that classes are not required to start and end within a term, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs. These requirements include: minimum and maximum term length restrictions for standard terms (see the discussion in the next section of this chapter); requirements for determining full-time enrollment (see Volume 1, Chapter 1); use of a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY), BBAY 1, BBAY 2, or BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6); and use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards (see Volume 7, Chapter 4). Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. Standard Terms: Semesters, Trimesters, and Quarters Semesters and trimesters contain between 14 and 21 weeks of instructional time. However, a summer term in a program using semesters or trimesters may contain fewer than 14 weeks. An academic calendar that uses semesters or trimesters traditionally has three terms, one each in the fall, spring, and summer, two of which comprise an academic year. For example, in a program using an SAY calendar, fall and spring would comprise an academic year. In a program using a']","Title IV funding interacts with different academic calendars in specific ways, depending on whether the program follows a standard term, non-term, or subscription-based schedule.

**Standard Term or Nonstandard Term Academic Calendar:**
- All classes begin and end within a set time frame called a term.
- Academic progress is measured in credit hours.
- Disbursements are aligned with these defined terms, based on the start and end dates.
- Disbursement timing is scheduled according to each term's calendar.

**Non-term Academic Calendar:**
- Classes do not have fixed start and end dates within a term.
- Progress can be measured in credit or clock hours.
- Disbursements depend on the student's progress and the program's structure, rather than fixed calendar dates.

**Subscription-based Academic Calendar:**
- Used exclusively by subscription-based programs.
- These programs have flexible periods called subscription periods, with minimum and maximum lengths.
- Disbursement procedures include:
  - For the first two subscription periods, schools can disburse Title IV funds up to 10 days before the start of the subscription period.
  - Starting from the third subscription period, early disbursement (10 days before the start) is only permitted if the student has completed the required coursework hours.
  - If the student has not met the coursework completion requirement, the school must wait until the student has completed the necessary hours before disbursing funds.
- The number of hours associated with each subscription period is added to the student's cumulative total for disbursement eligibility.

**Differences in Procedures:**
- **Standard/Nonstandard Term:** Disbursements are tied to scheduled terms, with timing based on the start and end dates.
- **Non-term:** Disbursements are based on student progress and program structure, not fixed periods.
- **Subscription-based:** Disbursements are based on subscription periods, with specific rules for early disbursement and coursework completion, involving cumulative hour tracking.

In summary, the key differences involve the timing and conditions for disbursement, with subscription-based programs requiring additional considerations for early disbursement and coursework completion compared to standard and non-term calendars.","Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. For standard term or nonstandard term calendars, terms are periods where all classes start and end within a set timeframe, and progress is measured in credit hours. Non-term calendars don’t have set start and end times for classes, and progress can be measured in credit or clock hours. Sometimes, a program with terms must be treated as non-term for Title IV purposes. Subscription-based programs are term-based but charge students by subscription, and classes don’t have to start or end within a specific timeframe. The rules for term-based programs that aren’t subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs, including term length restrictions, full-time enrollment requirements, monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression, and Pell Grant formulas.

This may be due to constraints imposed by outside licensing bodies or the need to accommodate schedules of entities with which students are being placed (e.g., school districts or hospitals); and Credit hours associated with the practicum or clinical experience must be associated with the term in which most of the training occurs, even if the starting and ending dates do not exactly align with the term dates and/or overlap with another term. If the clinical work meets all the above criteria, terms which include such clinical work are not required to be considered nonstandard, nor are such programs required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. This flexibility is limited to required clinical periods associated with standard term programs in medicine (including, but not limited to, allopathic, osteopathic, nursing, veterinary, dentistry, pharmacy, and physical therapy), and student teaching required to obtain a state teaching certificate. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for additional guidance on certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets the criteria described above is included in a standard term. Nonstandard Terms Generally, nonstandard terms are terms that are not semesters, trimesters, or quarters. For example, a 5-week term or a 23-week term would be considered a nonstandard term because no standard term can be fewer than nine weeks or greater than 21 weeks in length. Like standard terms, nonstandard terms may be equal in length or may be of different lengths. If a program is offered in a combination of standard terms and nonstandard terms, the program is considered to be offered in nonstandard terms. Also, like standard terms, nonstandard terms may not overlap within a program. Even if a school calls its terms semesters, trimesters, or quarters, they are considered to be nonstandard terms if they do not comply with the policy on standard term length, as described earlier. For instance, a 22-week semester or an 8-week quarter must be treated as a nonstandard term, because a semester cannot contain more than 21 weeks and a quarter must include a minimum of nine weeks. Semesters, trimesters, or quarters are also considered to be nonstandard terms if academic progress is not measured in the manner normally associated with the type of term. For example, if a program is offered in 15-week semesters but measures academic progress in quarter credit hours, the semesters would be considered nonstandard terms.']","According to Volume 8, Chapter 3, the specific exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans occur when clinical work that meets certain criteria is included in a standard or substantially equal nonstandard term (SE9W) of at least nine weeks. These exceptions are applicable when clinical work is incorporated into a term or nonstandard term and meet the outlined criteria.

The key points of these exceptions are:
- The school must associate the clinical work with the term during which the majority of the clinical work occurs.
- If the clinical work begins before the official start date of the associated term, the loan period start date is set to the beginning date of the clinical work, rather than the term start date.

This guidance impacts federal student aid administration by allowing clinical or practicum experiences—such as those required in programs like medicine, nursing, dentistry, pharmacy, physical therapy, and teaching certification—to be included within standard or nonstandard terms. As a result, this inclusion can lead to exceptions in the timing of loan disbursements and the start of the loan period, ensuring that students engaged in clinically required work can receive aid aligned with their actual clinical schedule, rather than being restricted by standard disbursement rules.","Volume 8, Chapter 3 provides additional guidance on certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets the specified criteria is included in a standard term. Specifically, if all students in a program must participate in a practicum or clinical experience as a condition for licensure, the school has little or no control over the length or dates of the clinical experience, and the credit hours are associated with the term in which most training occurs, then the terms including such clinical work are not required to be considered nonstandard, nor are the programs required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. This flexibility applies to required clinical periods in standard term programs in fields such as medicine, nursing, veterinary, dentistry, pharmacy, physical therapy, and student teaching for state certification. Therefore, federal student aid administrators can continue to treat these programs as standard term for loan period and disbursement purposes, following the exceptions outlined in Volume 8, Chapter 3.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer

Effect of Accelerated Progression on Disbursement Timing in a Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Program The Pell Grant or TEACH Grant amount that a student is eligible to receive for a payment period in a clock-hour or non- term credit-hour program is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods for the program that are established at the beginning of the program based on the program length (as described earlier in this chapter). These scheduled payment periods do not change, regardless of a student9s rate of progression through a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program. This means that if a student completes additional weeks of instructional time or hours while completing the other measure of a payment period, the actual number of weeks or hours that the student completes before a disbursement can be made for the next payment period may differ from the number of weeks or hours in the scheduled payment period used to determine the student9s grant amount for the payment period. Although a student9s completion of additional weeks or hours in a payment period has no effect on the scheduled payment periods for purposes of determining Pell Grant and TEACH Grant payment amounts, an undergraduate student who accelerates in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year of a program. Specifically, if a student enrolled in a program that is greater than one academic year in length completes additional clock or credit hours prior to the final academic year of the program, this may result in a final period of study that contains fewer clock or credit hours than the number of hours in the program9s defined academic year. In this circumstance, the Direct Loan annual loan limit for an undergraduate student must be prorated (reduced).

However, to receive a disbursement of Title IV aid for each subsequent subscription period in the program, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods in the program, excluding the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in the most recently attended subscription period.

Multiple Disbursements Within a Payment Period The regulations governing the Title IV programs generally permit schools to pay Title IV funds at such times and in such installments within each payment period as will best meet students9 needs. This gives schools the ability to apportion the payment if doing so will be in the best interest of the student. For example, if a payment period is particularly long, a school might choose to pay in multiple installments to the extent program requirements permit to ensure that a student will have funds to pay rent later in the payment period. If a school chooses to schedule multiple Direct Loan disbursements within a single payment period, the disbursements must be substantially equal. Note also that if the loan period for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless the school qualifies for an exception to the multiple disbursement requirement.

This flexibility applies when all other criteria are met, allowing clinical work to be incorporated into standard terms even if it overlaps with other terms or does not align perfectly with traditional term dates.","If a practicum or clinical experience is required for licensure and meets specific criteria—such as being mandatory for all students, required for licensure, and having little or no school control over its timing—it can be included in a standard term program without causing the program to be classified as non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps terms.

In a standard term or nonstandard term academic calendar, a term is generally a period in which all classes are scheduled to begin and end within a set time frame, and academic progress is measured in credit hours. In a non-term academic calendar, classes do not begin and end within a set time frame, such as a term. Academic progress in a non-term program can be measured in either credit or clock hours. In some cases (as discussed below), a program with terms must be treated as a non-term program for Title IV purposes. A subscription-based academic calendar is used only by subscription-based programs. A subscription-based program is a term-based program in which the school charges a student for each term on a subscription basis with the expectation that the student will complete a specified number of credit hours (or the equivalent) during that term. However, classes in a subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term, as is the case in a term-based calendar that is not subscription-based. For more detail on subscription-based programs, see Volume 2, Chapter 2. A subscription-based academic calendar consists of ""subscription periods"" that are either standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms (for guidance on when terms are considered to be substantially equal in length, see <Payment periods for programs using standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms= later in this chapter). Substantially equal nonstandard terms may be of any length, but if they are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for purposes of monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6 for more information on BBAY 3). Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length are not permissible in a subscription-based academic calendar. The term ""subscription period"" is synonymous with ""term"" and ""payment period"" (payment periods are covered later in this chapter). Except for the fact that classes are not required to start and end within a term, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs. These requirements include: minimum and maximum term length restrictions for standard terms (see the discussion in the next section of this chapter); requirements for determining full-time enrollment (see Volume 1, Chapter 1); use of a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY), BBAY 1, BBAY 2, or BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6); and use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards (see Volume 7, Chapter 4). Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. Standard Terms: Semesters, Trimesters, and Quarters Semesters and trimesters contain between 14 and 21 weeks of instructional time. However, a summer term in a program using semesters or trimesters may contain fewer than 14 weeks. An academic calendar that uses semesters or trimesters traditionally has three terms, one each in the fall, spring, and summer, two of which comprise an academic year. For example, in a program using an SAY calendar, fall and spring would comprise an academic year. In a program using a', '<2-hop>\n\nDisbursement Timing in Subscription-Based Programs For the first two subscription periods (terms) that a student attends in a subscription-based program, there is no requirement for the student to have completed a certain amount of coursework before receiving a disbursement of Title IV funds (the same as in any other term-based program using credit hours). However, to receive a disbursement of Title IV aid for each subsequent subscription period in the program, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods in the program, excluding the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in the most recently attended subscription period. For more detailed guidance on the disbursement rules for subscription-based programs, including examples, refer to Appendix B at the end of this chapter. Multiple Disbursements Within a Payment Period The regulations governing the Title IV programs generally permit schools to pay Title IV funds at such times and in such installments within each payment period as will best meet students9 needs. This gives schools the ability to apportion the payment if doing so will be in the best interest of the student. For example, if a payment period is particularly long, a school might choose to pay in multiple installments to the extent program requirements permit to ensure that a student will have funds to pay rent later in the payment period. If a school chooses to schedule multiple Direct Loan disbursements within a single payment period, the disbursements must be substantially equal. Note also that if the loan period for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless the school qualifies for an exception to the multiple disbursement requirement. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more']","A subscription-based academic calendar affects the timing of Title IV aid disbursements as follows:

- For the first two subscription periods, disbursements can be made up to 10 days before the start of each period without requiring coursework completion. Disbursements are made at the beginning of each of these periods regardless of coursework completion.

- Starting with the third subscription period and for each subsequent period, students must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total hours enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods (excluding the most recent period) to be eligible for a disbursement.

- Additionally, beginning with the third period, early disbursement 10 days before the start of the period is only permitted if the student has met the coursework completion requirement. If the student has not completed the required hours, the school cannot disburse funds until the student fulfills this coursework requirement.","in a subscription-based academic calendar, which is used only by subscription-based programs, the timing of title iv aid disbursement is affected by specific requirements. for the first two subscription periods (terms) that a student attends, there is no requirement for the student to have completed a certain amount of coursework before receiving a disbursement of title iv funds, similar to other term-based programs using credit hours. however, for each subsequent subscription period, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods, excluding the most recently attended subscription period. this means that after the first two periods, students must demonstrate completion of prior enrolled credit hours to continue receiving disbursements. additionally, schools may choose to make multiple, substantially equal disbursements within a payment period to best meet students' needs, and if a direct loan period is a single payment period, it must be disbursed in at least two installments unless an exception applies.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer

This may be due to constraints imposed by outside licensing bodies or the need to accommodate schedules of entities with which students are being placed (e.g., school districts or hospitals); and Credit hours associated with the practicum or clinical experience must be associated with the term in which most of the training occurs, even if the starting and ending dates do not exactly align with the term dates and/or overlap with another term. If the clinical work meets all the above criteria, terms which include such clinical work are not required to be considered nonstandard, nor are such programs required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. This flexibility is limited to required clinical periods associated with standard term programs in medicine (including, but not limited to, allopathic, osteopathic, nursing, veterinary, dentistry, pharmacy, and physical therapy), and student teaching required to obtain a state teaching certificate. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for additional guidance on certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets the criteria described above is included in a standard term. Nonstandard Terms Generally, nonstandard terms are terms that are not semesters, trimesters, or quarters. For example, a 5-week term or a 23-week term would be considered a nonstandard term because no standard term can be fewer than nine weeks or greater than 21 weeks in length. Like standard terms, nonstandard terms may be equal in length or may be of different lengths. If a program is offered in a combination of standard terms and nonstandard terms, the program is considered to be offered in nonstandard terms. Also, like standard terms, nonstandard terms may not overlap within a program. Even if a school calls its terms semesters, trimesters, or quarters, they are considered to be nonstandard terms if they do not comply with the policy on standard term length, as described earlier. For instance, a 22-week semester or an 8-week quarter must be treated as a nonstandard term, because a semester cannot contain more than 21 weeks and a quarter must include a minimum of nine weeks. Semesters, trimesters, or quarters are also considered to be nonstandard terms if academic progress is not measured in the manner normally associated with the type of term. For example, if a program is offered in 15-week semesters but measures academic progress in quarter credit hours, the semesters would be considered nonstandard terms.', '<2-hop>\n\nNon-Term Characteristics A program that measures progress in clock hours is always treated as a non-term program.

Specifically, non-term programs are characterized by the lack of fixed start and end dates and are often measured by clock-hours or credit-hours rather than traditional semesters or quarters.

Regarding how non-term program characteristics affect federal aid payment periods, federal aid tracks progress based on instructional time and credits. For non-term programs, payment periods are determined by instructional time, and terms must be substantially equal. Borrowers must complete all credits and instructional time to maintain or regain eligibility. Payment periods are also affected by the completion of portions of the program, especially if they are not more than half an academic year, which can influence repayment and forgiveness tracking.

For the Direct Loan Program only, this same requirement applies to students who are enrolled in programs with nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length. Effect of Accelerated Progression on Disbursement Timing in a Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Program The Pell Grant or TEACH Grant amount that a student is eligible to receive for a payment period in a clock-hour or non- term credit-hour program is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods for the program that are established at the beginning of the program based on the program length (as described earlier in this chapter). These scheduled payment periods do not change, regardless of a student9s rate of progression through a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program. This means that if a student completes additional weeks of instructional time or hours while completing the other measure of a payment period, the actual number of weeks or hours that the student completes before a disbursement can be made for the next payment period may differ from the number of weeks or hours in the scheduled payment period used to determine the student9s grant amount for the payment period. Although a student9s completion of additional weeks or hours in a payment period has no effect on the scheduled payment periods for purposes of determining Pell Grant and TEACH Grant payment amounts, an undergraduate student who accelerates in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year of a program. Specifically, if a student enrolled in a program that is greater than one academic year in length completes additional clock or credit hours prior to the final academic year of the program, this may result in a final period of study that contains fewer clock or credit hours than the number of hours in the program9s defined academic year. In this circumstance, the Direct Loan annual loan limit for an undergraduate student must be prorated (reduced). The principles described above are illustrated by the examples in Appendix A at the end of this chapter. For guidance on calculating Pell Grant and TEACH Grant awards for clock-hour and non-term credit-hour programs, see Volume 7. For information on Direct Loan annual loan limit proration and annual loan limit progression in clock-hour and non-term credit- hour programs, see Volume 8, Chapters 5 and 6. If your school is unable to determine when a student has successfully completed half of the credit or clock hours in a program, academic year, or remainder of a program, the student is considered to have begun the second payment period of the program, academic year, or remainder of a program at the later of the date (identified by your school) that the student has successfully completed: half of the academic coursework in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program; or half of the number of weeks of instructional time in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program.']","Federal Direct Loans are typically fixed-term loans, meaning they have a set duration based on the program's length. They are not designed to be subscription-based or non-term. If you are enrolled in a program that is non-traditional or allows for faster completion, the loan terms generally do not change; you will still be responsible for repayment according to the original schedule once you graduate or leave school.

For the Direct Loan Program only, this same requirement applies to students who are enrolled in programs with nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length. Effect of Accelerated Progression on Disbursement Timing in a Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Program The Pell Grant or TEACH Grant amount that a student is eligible to receive for a payment period in a clock-hour or non- term credit-hour program is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods for the program that are established at the beginning of the program based on the program length (as described earlier in this chapter). These scheduled payment periods do not change, regardless of a student9s rate of progression through a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program. This means that if a student completes additional weeks of instructional time or hours while completing the other measure of a payment period, the actual number of weeks or hours that the student completes before a disbursement can be made for the next payment period may differ from the number of weeks or hours in the scheduled payment period used to determine the student9s grant amount for the payment period. Although a student9s completion of additional weeks or hours in a payment period has no effect on the scheduled payment periods for purposes of determining Pell Grant and TEACH Grant payment amounts, an undergraduate student who accelerates in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year of a program. Specifically, if a student enrolled in a program that is greater than one academic year in length completes additional clock or credit hours prior to the final academic year of the program, this may result in a final period of study that contains fewer clock or credit hours than the number of hours in the program9s defined academic year. In this circumstance, the Direct Loan annual loan limit for an undergraduate student must be prorated (reduced). The principles described above are illustrated by the examples in Appendix A at the end of this chapter. For guidance on calculating Pell Grant and TEACH Grant awards for clock-hour and non-term credit-hour programs, see Volume 7. For information on Direct Loan annual loan limit proration and annual loan limit progression in clock-hour and non-term credit- hour programs, see Volume 8, Chapters 5 and 6. If your school is unable to determine when a student has successfully completed half of the credit or clock hours in a program, academic year, or remainder of a program, the student is considered to have begun the second payment period of the program, academic year, or remainder of a program at the later of the date (identified by your school) that the student has successfully completed: half of the academic coursework in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program; or half of the number of weeks of instructional time in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program.', '<2-hop>\n\nInclusion of Clinical Work in a Standard Term Periods of medical and education program clinical work which is conducted outside the classroom may not be included in a standard term, unless all of the following apply: All students in the program must participate in the practicum or clinical experience, and they must be required to complete the practicum or clinical experience as a condition for applying for licensure or authorization to practice the occupation they intend to pursue; The school has little or no control over the length or starting and ending dates of the practicum or clinical experience. This may be due to constraints imposed by outside licensing bodies or the need to accommodate schedules of entities with which students are being placed (e.g., school districts or hospitals); and Credit hours associated with the practicum or clinical experience must be associated with the term in which most of the training occurs, even if the starting and ending dates do not exactly align with the term dates and/or overlap with another term. If the clinical work meets all the above criteria, terms which include such clinical work are not required to be considered nonstandard, nor are such programs required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. This flexibility is limited to required clinical periods associated with standard term programs in medicine (including, but not limited to, allopathic, osteopathic, nursing, veterinary, dentistry, pharmacy, and physical therapy), and student teaching required to obtain a state teaching certificate. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for additional guidance on certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets the criteria described above is included in a standard term. Nonstandard Terms Generally, nonstandard terms are terms that are not semesters, trimesters, or quarters. For example, a 5-week term or a 23-week term would be considered a nonstandard term because no standard term can be fewer than nine weeks or greater than 21 weeks in length. Like standard terms, nonstandard terms may be equal in length or may be of different lengths. If a program is offered in a combination of standard terms and nonstandard terms, the program is considered to be offered in nonstandard terms. Also, like standard terms, nonstandard terms may not overlap within a program. Even if a school calls its terms semesters, trimesters, or quarters, they are considered to be nonstandard terms if they do not comply with the policy on standard term length, as described earlier. For instance, a 22-week semester or an 8-week quarter must be treated as a nonstandard term, because a semester cannot contain more than 21 weeks and a quarter must include a minimum of nine weeks. Semesters, trimesters, or quarters are also considered to be nonstandard terms if academic progress is not measured in the manner normally associated with the type of term. For example, if a program is offered in 15-week semesters but measures academic progress in quarter credit hours, the semesters would be considered nonstandard terms.']","Clinical work and accelerated progression can influence the eligibility and timing of Direct Loan disbursements for students in a nonstandard term program. If clinical work is included in a term and begins before the official start date of that term, the loan period start date is adjusted to the beginning date of the clinical work rather than the term's start date. This means that the disbursement cannot occur before the clinical work begins.

Additionally, for subsequent disbursements within a loan period that includes multiple terms, if the clinical work associated with a later term has not yet started when that term begins, the disbursement cannot be made earlier than 10 days before the clinical work starts. This ensures that loan funds are disbursed in alignment with the student's clinical schedule and progression.

In summary, clinical work and accelerated progression can delay or modify the timing of loan disbursements, but they do not necessarily disqualify a student from receiving a Direct Loan. The disbursement timing is adjusted to match the clinical schedule and progression of the student.","If a student in a nonstandard term program receives a Direct Loan, clinical work that meets specific criteria (such as being required for licensure and having little or no school control over its schedule) can be included in a standard term, and exceptions to normal Direct Loan disbursement timing may apply. However, if the student accelerates their progression in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program, they may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year. This is because completing additional hours before the final year can result in a final period with fewer hours than the defined academic year, requiring the Direct Loan annual loan limit to be prorated (reduced).",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

In a standard term or nonstandard term academic calendar, a term is generally a period in which all classes are scheduled to begin and end within a set time frame, and academic progress is measured in credit hours. In a non-term academic calendar, classes do not begin and end within a set time frame, such as a term. Academic progress in a non-term program can be measured in either credit or clock hours. In some cases (as discussed below), a program with terms must be treated as a non-term program for Title IV purposes. A subscription-based academic calendar is used only by subscription-based programs. A subscription-based program is a term-based program in which the school charges a student for each term on a subscription basis with the expectation that the student will complete a specified number of credit hours (or the equivalent) during that term. However, classes in a subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term, as is the case in a term-based calendar that is not subscription-based. For more detail on subscription-based programs, see Volume 2, Chapter 2. A subscription-based academic calendar consists of ""subscription periods"" that are either standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms (for guidance on when terms are considered to be substantially equal in length, see <Payment periods for programs using standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms= later in this chapter). Substantially equal nonstandard terms may be of any length, but if they are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for purposes of monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6 for more information on BBAY 3). Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length are not permissible in a subscription-based academic calendar. The term ""subscription period"" is synonymous with ""term"" and ""payment period"" (payment periods are covered later in this chapter). Except for the fact that classes are not required to start and end within a term, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs. These requirements include: minimum and maximum term length restrictions for standard terms (see the discussion in the next section of this chapter); requirements for determining full-time enrollment (see Volume 1, Chapter 1); use of a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY), BBAY 1, BBAY 2, or BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6); and use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards (see Volume 7, Chapter 4). Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. Standard Terms: Semesters, Trimesters, and Quarters Semesters and trimesters contain between 14 and 21 weeks of instructional time. However, a summer term in a program using semesters or trimesters may contain fewer than 14 weeks. An academic calendar that uses semesters or trimesters traditionally has three terms, one each in the fall, spring, and summer, two of which comprise an academic year. For example, in a program using an SAY calendar, fall and spring would comprise an academic year. In a program using a', '<2-hop>\n\nInclusion of Clinical Work in a Standard Term Periods of medical and education program clinical work which is conducted outside the classroom may not be included in a standard term, unless all of the following apply: All students in the program must participate in the practicum or clinical experience, and they must be required to complete the practicum or clinical experience as a condition for applying for licensure or authorization to practice the occupation they intend to pursue; The school has little or no control over the length or starting and ending dates of the practicum or clinical experience.

If the clinical work meets all the above criteria, terms which include such clinical work are not required to be considered nonstandard, nor are such programs required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. This flexibility is limited to required clinical periods associated with standard term programs in medicine (including, but not limited to, allopathic, osteopathic, nursing, veterinary, dentistry, pharmacy, and physical therapy), and student teaching required to obtain a state teaching certificate. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for additional guidance on certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets the criteria described above is included in a standard term. Nonstandard Terms Generally, nonstandard terms are terms that are not semesters, trimesters, or quarters. For example, a 5-week term or a 23-week term would be considered a nonstandard term because no standard term can be fewer than nine weeks or greater than 21 weeks in length. Like standard terms, nonstandard terms may be equal in length or may be of different lengths. If a program is offered in a combination of standard terms and nonstandard terms, the program is considered to be offered in nonstandard terms. Also, like standard terms, nonstandard terms may not overlap within a program. Even if a school calls its terms semesters, trimesters, or quarters, they are considered to be nonstandard terms if they do not comply with the policy on standard term length, as described earlier. For instance, a 22-week semester or an 8-week quarter must be treated as a nonstandard term, because a semester cannot contain more than 21 weeks and a quarter must include a minimum of nine weeks. Semesters, trimesters, or quarters are also considered to be nonstandard terms if academic progress is not measured in the manner normally associated with the type of term. For example, if a program is offered in 15-week semesters but measures academic progress in quarter credit hours, the semesters would be considered nonstandard terms.']","The search results indicate that information about subscription-based programs and exceptions for clinical work in standard terms, particularly regarding how federal student aid disburses funds based on academic terms, can be found in federal regulations and official reports.
