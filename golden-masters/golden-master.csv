"As a consumer rights advocate, how should I address the issue of re-amortization delays for federal student loans after the COVID-19 forbearance ended, especially considering the significant increase in monthly payments from $180.00 to $360.00 and the potential financial hardship for many borrowers?","[""Customer Issue: Dealing with your lender or servicer\nProduct: Student loan\nComplaint Details: The federal student loan COVID-19 forbearance program ended in XX/XX/XXXX. However, payments were not re-amortized on my federal student loans currently serviced by Nelnet until very recently. The new payment amount that is effective starting with the XX/XX/XXXX payment will nearly double my payment from {$180.00} per month to {$360.00} per month. I'm fortunate that my current financial position allows me to be able to handle the increased payment amount, but I am sure there are likely many borrowers who are not in the same position. The re-amortization should have occurred once the forbearance ended to reduce the impact to borrowers.""]","The complaint details indicate that the federal student loan COVID-19 forbearance program ended in a specific date, but re-amortization of the loans serviced by Nelnet did not occur until very recently. As a result, the new payment amount starting from a certain date will nearly double the previous payment from $180.00 to $360.00. While the individual borrower in this case can handle the increased payment, many others may face financial hardship. The re-amortization should have taken place promptly after the forbearance ended to lessen the impact on borrowers, and addressing this delay is essential to protect borrower rights and prevent undue financial strain.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
