In a standard term or nonstandard term academic calendar, a term is generally a period in which all classes are scheduled to begin and end within a set time frame, and academic progress is measured in credit hours. In a non-term academic calendar, classes do not begin and end within a set time frame, such as a term. Academic progress in a non-term program can be measured in either credit or clock hours. In some cases (as discussed below), a program with terms must be treated as a non-term program for Title IV purposes. A subscription-based academic calendar is used only by subscription-based programs. A subscription-based program is a term-based program in which the school charges a student for each term on a subscription basis with the expectation that the student will complete a specified number of credit hours (or the equivalent) during that term. However, classes in a subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term, as is the case in a term-based calendar that is not subscription-based. For more detail on subscription-based programs, see Volume 2, Chapter 2. A subscription-based academic calendar consists of ""subscription periods"" that are either standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms (for guidance on when terms are considered to be substantially equal in length, see <Payment periods for programs using standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms= later in this chapter). Substantially equal nonstandard terms may be of any length, but if they are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for purposes of monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6 for more information on BBAY 3). Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length are not permissible in a subscription-based academic calendar. The term ""subscription period"" is synonymous with ""term"" and ""payment period"" (payment periods are covered later in this chapter). Except for the fact that classes are not required to start and end within a term, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs. These requirements include: minimum and maximum term length restrictions for standard terms (see the discussion in the next section of this chapter); requirements for determining full-time enrollment (see Volume 1, Chapter 1); use of a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY), BBAY 1, BBAY 2, or BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6); and use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards (see Volume 7, Chapter 4). Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. Standard Terms: Semesters, Trimesters, and Quarters Semesters and trimesters contain between 14 and 21 weeks of instructional time. However, a summer term in a program using semesters or trimesters may contain fewer than 14 weeks. An academic calendar that uses semesters or trimesters traditionally has three terms, one each in the fall, spring, and summer, two of which comprise an academic year. For example, in a program using an SAY calendar, fall and spring would comprise an academic year. In a program using a']","The structure of an academic calendar, such as standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based, influences how financial aid, including Pell Grants, is calculated and disbursed. 

Pell Grant disbursements typically occur in multiple installments throughout the academic year, with the exact schedule varying by institution. The type of academic calendar affects the timing and amount of these disbursements. For example:

- **Standard Term Calendars**: Disbursements are often aligned with each term or semester, with funds released at the start of each term.
- **Nonstandard Term Calendars**: Disbursements may be spread out over shorter or irregular periods, depending on the institution's schedule.
- **Non-term or Subscription-based Calendars**: These may involve continuous enrollment or rolling admissions, leading to more flexible disbursement schedules that are tailored to individual student progress and enrollment status.

Additionally, Pell Grant eligibility is based on the student's lifetime eligibility used, which is calculated over the entire award year regardless of the calendar structure. The academic calendar type can influence how quickly students access their funds but does not change the total amount awarded, which is determined by federal guidelines and the student's financial need.

For specific disbursement schedules and how they relate to your institution's academic calendar, it is best to consult your school's financial aid office.","The structure of an academic calendar—whether it is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based—affects how Pell Grant awards are calculated and disbursed. In subscription-based programs, which are term-based but do not require classes to start and end within a specific timeframe, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply. This includes the use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards. The type of academic calendar determines the applicable Pell Grant formula and the timing of aid disbursement under Title IV programs.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
"medicine program clinical work, it gotta be in standard term or not?",[],"['Inclusion of Clinical Work in a Standard Term Periods of medical and education program clinical work which is conducted outside the classroom may not be included in a standard term, unless all of the following apply: All students in the program must participate in the practicum or clinical experience, and they must be required to complete the practicum or clinical experience as a condition for applying for licensure or authorization to practice the occupation they intend to pursue; The school has little or no control over the length or starting and ending dates of the practicum or clinical experience. This may be due to constraints imposed by outside licensing bodies or the need to accommodate schedules of entities with which students are being placed (e.g., school districts or hospitals); and Credit hours associated with the practicum or clinical experience must be associated with the term in which most of the training occurs, even if the starting and ending dates do not exactly align with the term dates and/or overlap with another term. If the clinical work meets all the above criteria, terms which include such clinical work are not required to be considered nonstandard, nor are such programs required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. This flexibility is limited to required clinical periods associated with standard term programs in medicine (including, but not limited to, allopathic, osteopathic, nursing, veterinary, dentistry, pharmacy, and physical therapy), and student teaching required to obtain a state teaching certificate. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for additional guidance on certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets the criteria described above is included in a standard term. Nonstandard Terms Generally, nonstandard terms are terms that are not semesters, trimesters, or quarters. For example, a 5-week term or a 23-week term would be considered a nonstandard term because no standard term can be fewer than nine weeks or greater than 21 weeks in length. Like standard terms, nonstandard terms may be equal in length or may be of different lengths. If a program is offered in a combination of standard terms and nonstandard terms, the program is considered to be offered in nonstandard terms. Also, like standard terms, nonstandard terms may not overlap within a program. Even if a school calls its terms semesters, trimesters, or quarters, they are considered to be nonstandard terms if they do not comply with the policy on standard term length, as described earlier. For instance, a 22-week semester or an 8-week quarter must be treated as a nonstandard term, because a semester cannot contain more than 21 weeks and a quarter must include a minimum of nine weeks. Semesters, trimesters, or quarters are also considered to be nonstandard terms if academic progress is not measured in the manner normally associated with the type of term. For example, if a program is offered in 15-week semesters but measures academic progress in quarter credit hours, the semesters would be considered nonstandard terms.']","Could you please clarify your question a bit more? Are you asking whether clinical work in a medicine program should be described using standard medical terminology, or are you referring to something else related to medicine programs? Providing more details will help me give you a more accurate answer.","If the clinical work in a medicine program meets all the criteria listed—like all students must do it, it's required for licensure, the school don't control the dates, and the credit hours go with the term where most training happens—then terms with that clinical work don't gotta be considered nonstandard, even if the clinical work overlaps another term.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer

"so like if a student gettin a TEACH Grant in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program, and they finish more weeks or hours than scheduled in a payment period, does that change how much TEACH Grant they get or when they get the next disbursement, or what happen if they go faster than normal?",[],"['both the credit or clock hours and the weeks of instructional time in a payment period before receiving a disbursement of Pell Grant, FSEOG, TEACH Grant or Direct Loan funds for the next payment period. For the Direct Loan Program only, this same requirement applies to students who are enrolled in programs with nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length. Effect of Accelerated Progression on Disbursement Timing in a Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Program The Pell Grant or TEACH Grant amount that a student is eligible to receive for a payment period in a clock-hour or non- term credit-hour program is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods for the program that are established at the beginning of the program based on the program length (as described earlier in this chapter). These scheduled payment periods do not change, regardless of a student9s rate of progression through a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program. This means that if a student completes additional weeks of instructional time or hours while completing the other measure of a payment period, the actual number of weeks or hours that the student completes before a disbursement can be made for the next payment period may differ from the number of weeks or hours in the scheduled payment period used to determine the student9s grant amount for the payment period. Although a student9s completion of additional weeks or hours in a payment period has no effect on the scheduled payment periods for purposes of determining Pell Grant and TEACH Grant payment amounts, an undergraduate student who accelerates in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year of a program. Specifically, if a student enrolled in a program that is greater than one academic year in length completes additional clock or credit hours prior to the final academic year of the program, this may result in a final period of study that contains fewer clock or credit hours than the number of hours in the program9s defined academic year. In this circumstance, the Direct Loan annual loan limit for an undergraduate student must be prorated (reduced). The principles described above are illustrated by the examples in Appendix A at the end of this chapter. For guidance on calculating Pell Grant and TEACH Grant awards for clock-hour and non-term credit-hour programs, see Volume 7. For information on Direct Loan annual loan limit proration and annual loan limit progression in clock-hour and non-term credit- hour programs, see Volume 8, Chapters 5 and 6. If your school is unable to determine when a student has successfully completed half of the credit or clock hours in a program, academic year, or remainder of a program, the student is considered to have begun the second payment period of the program, academic year, or remainder of a program at the later of the date (identified by your school) that the student has successfully completed: half of the academic coursework in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program; or half of the number of weeks of instructional time in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program.']","If a student receiving a TEACH Grant in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program completes more weeks or hours than scheduled in a payment period, it does not affect the amount of TEACH Grant they receive or the timing of their next disbursement. The scheduled payment periods remain the same regardless of the student's rate of progression. 

However, if the student progresses faster than normal, particularly in a program longer than one academic year, it may result in a final period of study that contains fewer clock or credit hours than originally established at the beginning of the program. This accelerated completion can also lead to reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year, but it does not change the scheduled payment periods or the disbursement timing for the TEACH Grant.","if a student gettin a TEACH Grant in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program finishes more weeks or hours than scheduled in a payment period, it don’t change the scheduled payment periods used to figure out the TEACH Grant amount for that period. the scheduled payment periods stay the same no matter how fast the student goes, so the grant amount don’t change. but the actual number of weeks or hours the student completes before gettin the next disbursement might be different from the scheduled amount. so, goin faster don’t affect the TEACH Grant payment amount, just when the next disbursement can happen.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer

However, to receive a disbursement of Title IV aid for each subsequent subscription period in the program, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods in the program, excluding the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in the most recently attended subscription period. For more detailed guidance on the disbursement rules for subscription-based programs, including examples, refer to Appendix B at the end of this chapter. Multiple Disbursements Within a Payment Period The regulations governing the Title IV programs generally permit schools to pay Title IV funds at such times and in such installments within each payment period as will best meet students9 needs. This gives schools the ability to apportion the payment if doing so will be in the best interest of the student. For example, if a payment period is particularly long, a school might choose to pay in multiple installments to the extent program requirements permit to ensure that a student will have funds to pay rent later in the payment period. If a school chooses to schedule multiple Direct Loan disbursements within a single payment period, the disbursements must be substantially equal. Note also that if the loan period for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless the school qualifies for an exception to the multiple disbursement requirement.

For Direct Loans specifically, this requirement also applies to students enrolled in programs with nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length. Disbursements can be made up to 10 days before the start of the payment period, provided the student has met the coursework completion requirements.

In subscription-based programs, the disbursement process differs in that there is no requirement for students to have completed a specific amount of coursework before receiving aid for the first two subscription periods. For these initial periods, a school can disburse funds up to 10 days before the start of each subscription period regardless of coursework completion. However, starting with the third subscription period and for all subsequent periods, students must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total hours for which they were enrolled in all previous subscription periods (excluding the hours for the current period) before they can receive a disbursement. This means that for later periods, students must meet coursework completion requirements to be eligible for disbursement.","In clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs, students must complete both the required credit or clock hours and the weeks of instructional time in a payment period before receiving a disbursement of Pell Grant, FSEOG, TEACH Grant, or Direct Loan funds for the next payment period.

1. Clock-hour or Non-term Credit-hour Programs:
- Students must successfully complete a certain amount of coursework or credit hours and weeks of instructional time in a payment period before receiving the next disbursement.
- Disbursements are contingent upon the student having completed the required coursework or hours associated with the current payment period.
- For programs with nonstandard terms, the same requirement applies to disbursements of Direct Loans.
- Accelerated progression in these programs may affect disbursement timing, but the core requirement remains that coursework or hours must be completed before subsequent disbursements.

2. Subscription-based Programs:
- There is no requirement for students to have completed a specified amount of coursework before receiving disbursements for the first two subscription periods.
- Starting with the third subscription period, students must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total hours for all previously attended subscription periods (excluding hours for which disbursements have already been made).
- Disbursements can be made up to 10 days before the start of the subscription period, provided the student has met the coursework completion requirements from the third period onward.

Regarding flexibility in scheduling multiple disbursements within a payment period:
- Schools have the flexibility to schedule disbursements at times and in installments that best meet students' needs.
- They can divide payments over a long payment period to ensure students have funds later in the period.
- If the loan period is a single payment period and more than half of the period has elapsed before disbursement, the school may include loan proceeds for the entire period in one disbursement.
- Schools can make multiple disbursements within a payment period as long as the disbursements are substantially equal, unless an exception applies.
- For programs with modules, disbursements within a payment period do not create additional payment periods, and the timing must adhere to specific rules.

Even if a school calls its terms semesters, trimesters, or quarters, they are considered to be nonstandard terms if they do not comply with the policy on standard term length, as described earlier. For instance, a 22-week semester or an 8-week quarter must be treated as a nonstandard term, because a semester cannot contain more than 21 weeks and a quarter must include a minimum of nine weeks. Semesters, trimesters, or quarters are also considered to be nonstandard terms if academic progress is not measured in the manner normally associated with the type of term. For example, if a program is offered in 15-week semesters but measures academic progress in quarter credit hours, the semesters would be considered nonstandard terms.', '<2-hop>\n\nNon-Term Characteristics A program that measures progress in clock hours is always treated as a non-term program. Except for subscription-based programs, a program that measures progress in credit-hours is considered to have a non- term calendar if it has: Courses that do not begin and end within a set period of time such as a term; Courses that overlap terms; Self-paced and independent study courses that overlap terms; or Sequential courses that do not begin and end within a term. Payment Periods The payment period is applicable to all Title IV programs except the Federal Work-Study (FWS) Program. For example, Title IV program disbursements (except FWS payments) must be made on a payment period basis, as discussed in detail']","A practicum or clinical experience required for licensure in a medical or education program can be included in a standard term if the following conditions are met:

1. All students in the program must participate in the practicum or clinical experience, and it must be a required condition for applying for licensure or authorization to practice.
2. The school has little or no control over the length or start and end dates of the practicum or clinical experience, often due to external licensing requirements or scheduling constraints imposed by outside entities such as hospitals or school districts.
3. The credit hours associated with the practicum or clinical experience are linked to the term in which most of the training occurs, even if the actual start and end dates overlap with another term or do not align exactly with the term dates.

This flexibility allows such clinical work to be included in a standard term even if it overlaps with another term or does not fit the traditional academic calendar.

In contrast, non-term programs are characterized by their flexible or non-standard academic calendar structures, such as modules or terms that are shorter than nine weeks or vary significantly in length. Nonstandard terms may include programs with varying lengths and schedules that do not conform to traditional semester, trimester, or quarter systems. For example, programs with 5-week or 23-week terms are considered nonstandard because they do not meet the criteria for standard academic terms.

Furthermore, programs offered in modules may be treated as nonstandard terms or non-term programs, depending on how the school applies its academic calendar and policies.","A practicum or clinical experience required for licensure in a medical or education program can be included in a standard term if all students must participate in it as a condition for licensure, the school has little or no control over its length or dates (often due to external licensing bodies or placement schedules), and the credit hours are associated with the term in which most training occurs, even if the dates do not align exactly with the term or overlap another term. If these criteria are met, the program is not required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. In contrast, non-term programs are defined by characteristics such as measuring progress in clock hours, having courses that do not begin and end within a set term, courses that overlap terms, or self-paced and independent study courses. Thus, while required clinical experiences can be included in standard terms under specific conditions, programs with the non-term characteristics described must be treated as non-term programs.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer
"How do the disbursement timing requirements for federal student aid differ between clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs and subscription-based programs, particularly regarding the completion of coursework or credit hours before receiving subsequent disbursements, and what flexibility do schools have in scheduling multiple disbursements within a payment period?",[],"['<1-hop>\n\nboth the credit or clock hours and the weeks of instructional time in a payment period before receiving a disbursement of Pell Grant, FSEOG, TEACH Grant or Direct Loan funds for the next payment period. For the Direct Loan Program only, this same requirement applies to students who are enrolled in programs with nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length. Effect of Accelerated Progression on Disbursement Timing in a Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Program The Pell Grant or TEACH Grant amount that a student is eligible to receive for a payment period in a clock-hour or non- term credit-hour program is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods for the program that are established at the beginning of the program based on the program length (as described earlier in this chapter). These scheduled payment periods do not change, regardless of a student9s rate of progression through a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program. This means that if a student completes additional weeks of instructional time or hours while completing the other measure of a payment period, the actual number of weeks or hours that the student completes before a disbursement can be made for the next payment period may differ from the number of weeks or hours in the scheduled payment period used to determine the student9s grant amount for the payment period. Although a student9s completion of additional weeks or hours in a payment period has no effect on the scheduled payment periods for purposes of determining Pell Grant and TEACH Grant payment amounts, an undergraduate student who accelerates in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year of a program. Specifically, if a student enrolled in a program that is greater than one academic year in length completes additional clock or credit hours prior to the final academic year of the program, this may result in a final period of study that contains fewer clock or credit hours than the number of hours in the program9s defined academic year. In this circumstance, the Direct Loan annual loan limit for an undergraduate student must be prorated (reduced). The principles described above are illustrated by the examples in Appendix A at the end of this chapter. For guidance on calculating Pell Grant and TEACH Grant awards for clock-hour and non-term credit-hour programs, see Volume 7. For information on Direct Loan annual loan limit proration and annual loan limit progression in clock-hour and non-term credit- hour programs, see Volume 8, Chapters 5 and 6. If your school is unable to determine when a student has successfully completed half of the credit or clock hours in a program, academic year, or remainder of a program, the student is considered to have begun the second payment period of the program, academic year, or remainder of a program at the later of the date (identified by your school) that the student has successfully completed: half of the academic coursework in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program; or half of the number of weeks of instructional time in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program.', '<2-hop>\n\nDisbursement Timing in Subscription-Based Programs For the first two subscription periods (terms) that a student attends in a subscription-based program, there is no requirement for the student to have completed a certain amount of coursework before receiving a disbursement of Title IV funds (the same as in any other term-based program using credit hours). However, to receive a disbursement of Title IV aid for each subsequent subscription period in the program, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods in the program, excluding the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in the most recently attended subscription period.

This gives schools the ability to apportion the payment if doing so will be in the best interest of the student. For example, if a payment period is particularly long, a school might choose to pay in multiple installments to the extent program requirements permit to ensure that a student will have funds to pay rent later in the payment period. If a school chooses to schedule multiple Direct Loan disbursements within a single payment period, the disbursements must be substantially equal. Note also that if the loan period for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless the school qualifies for an exception to the multiple disbursement requirement. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more']","The disbursement timing requirements for federal student aid differ between clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs and subscription-based programs as follows:

**Clock-hour or Non-term Credit-hour Programs:**
- Students must successfully complete a certain amount of coursework or credit hours and weeks of instructional time in a payment period before receiving the next disbursement.
- Disbursements are contingent upon the student's successful completion of these instructional components within each payment period.

**Subscription-based Programs:**
- For the first two subscription periods, there is no requirement for students to have completed a specific amount of coursework before receiving a disbursement.
- Starting with the third subscription period, students must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total hours for all previously attended subscription periods (excluding the current period) before they can receive a disbursement for that period.

Regarding the flexibility schools have in scheduling multiple disbursements within a payment period:
- Schools have the discretion to schedule multiple disbursements at times that best meet students' needs, such as dividing payments over a long payment period.
- If the loan period is a single payment period and more than half of the period has elapsed before the disbursement, the school may include the entire period's loan proceeds in one disbursement.
- Multiple disbursements within a payment period must generally be substantially equal unless an exception applies, such as when the loan period is a single payment period and certain conditions are met.

This flexibility allows schools to tailor disbursement schedules to support students effectively while adhering to federal regulations.","In clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs, students must complete both the required credit or clock hours and the weeks of instructional time in a payment period before they can receive a disbursement of Pell Grant, FSEOG, TEACH Grant, or Direct Loan funds for the next payment period. The scheduled payment periods are established at the beginning of the program and do not change based on a student's rate of progression. If a student accelerates and completes additional weeks or hours, this does not affect the scheduled payment periods for Pell Grant and TEACH Grant amounts, but may result in reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year if the last period contains fewer hours than the defined academic year, requiring proration of the loan limit.

In subscription-based programs, for the first two subscription periods, there is no requirement for the student to complete a certain amount of coursework before receiving a disbursement of Title IV funds. However, for each subsequent subscription period, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total number of hours for which they were enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods, excluding the most recently attended period.

Additionally, schools have flexibility in scheduling multiple disbursements within a payment period for Title IV programs. They may pay funds in such times and installments as best meet students’ needs, such as splitting payments in longer periods to help students manage expenses.

This may be due to constraints imposed by outside licensing bodies or the need to accommodate schedules of entities with which students are being placed (e.g., school districts or hospitals); and Credit hours associated with the practicum or clinical experience must be associated with the term in which most of the training occurs, even if the starting and ending dates do not exactly align with the term dates and/or overlap with another term. If the clinical work meets all the above criteria, terms which include such clinical work are not required to be considered nonstandard, nor are such programs required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. This flexibility is limited to required clinical periods associated with standard term programs in medicine (including, but not limited to, allopathic, osteopathic, nursing, veterinary, dentistry, pharmacy, and physical therapy), and student teaching required to obtain a state teaching certificate. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for additional guidance on certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets the criteria described above is included in a standard term. Nonstandard Terms Generally, nonstandard terms are terms that are not semesters, trimesters, or quarters. For example, a 5-week term or a 23-week term would be considered a nonstandard term because no standard term can be fewer than nine weeks or greater than 21 weeks in length. Like standard terms, nonstandard terms may be equal in length or may be of different lengths.

If a student receives a Direct Loan for a term that includes clinical work and the clinical work begins before the start date of the associated term, the loan period start date is set to the beginning date of the clinical work, rather than the term's start date.

Regarding disbursement timing rules, when clinical work is included in a standard term, the rules for disbursement are adjusted as follows: if a second or subsequent disbursement occurs in a loan period that includes multiple terms, and the clinical work for a subsequent term has not yet started when that term begins, the disbursement cannot be be made earlier than 10 days before the start of the clinical work. This ensures that disbursements align with the actual start of clinical work when it does not coincide with the beginning of the term.","Volume 8, Chapter 3 explains that clinical work in standard term programs may be included in a standard term if all students are required to participate as a condition for licensure, the school has little or no control over the practicum’s timing, and credit hours are associated with the term in which most training occurs.

In a standard term or nonstandard term academic calendar, a term is generally a period in which all classes are scheduled to begin and end within a set time frame, and academic progress is measured in credit hours. In a non-term academic calendar, classes do not begin and end within a set time frame, such as a term. Academic progress in a non-term program can be measured in either credit or clock hours. In some cases (as discussed below), a program with terms must be treated as a non-term program for Title IV purposes. A subscription-based academic calendar is used only by subscription-based programs. A subscription-based program is a term-based program in which the school charges a student for each term on a subscription basis with the expectation that the student will complete a specified number of credit hours (or the equivalent) during that term. However, classes in a subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term, as is the case in a term-based calendar that is not subscription-based. For more detail on subscription-based programs, see Volume 2, Chapter 2. A subscription-based academic calendar consists of ""subscription periods"" that are either standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms (for guidance on when terms are considered to be substantially equal in length, see <Payment periods for programs using standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms= later in this chapter). Substantially equal nonstandard terms may be of any length, but if they are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for purposes of monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6 for more information on BBAY 3). Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length are not permissible in a subscription-based academic calendar. The term ""subscription period"" is synonymous with ""term"" and ""payment period"" (payment periods are covered later in this chapter). Except for the fact that classes are not required to start and end within a term, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs. These requirements include: minimum and maximum term length restrictions for standard terms (see the discussion in the next section of this chapter); requirements for determining full-time enrollment (see Volume 1, Chapter 1); use of a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY), BBAY 1, BBAY 2, or BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6); and use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards (see Volume 7, Chapter 4). Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. Standard Terms: Semesters, Trimesters, and Quarters Semesters and trimesters contain between 14 and 21 weeks of instructional time. However, a summer term in a program using semesters or trimesters may contain fewer than 14 weeks. An academic calendar that uses semesters or trimesters traditionally has three terms, one each in the fall, spring, and summer, two of which comprise an academic year. For example, in a program using an SAY calendar, fall and spring would comprise an academic year. In a program using a']","The structure of non-term and subscription-based academic calendars significantly influences the calculation and disbursement of Pell Grant awards in clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs. The key points are:

1. Payment Periods: Pell Grants are paid in installments over the academic year or program, with disbursements tied to specific payment periods. These periods are determined based on the program's scheduled hours and weeks of instructional time.

2. Academic Year Definition: In non-term programs, the Pell award is generally not reduced for part-time enrollment unless the student is enrolled less than half-time. The academic year for a program may be defined by scheduled clock hours or credit hours and weeks of instructional time, which may not align with the institution's actual academic calendar.

3. Calendar Structure Impact: If a program's academic calendar does not match its defined academic year—such as having nonstandard terms (e.g., four 8-week terms instead of a continuous 30-week period)—this affects how payment periods are established. For example, a program might define an academic year as 24 semester hours and 30 weeks, but the actual calendar could consist of four 8-week terms totaling 32 weeks, impacting disbursement timing.

4. Disbursement Timing: The timing of disbursements depends on whether the scheduled hours and weeks in each payment period meet the minimum regulatory requirements (e.g., at least 30 weeks for credit-hour programs or 26 weeks for clock-hour programs). If the calendar is shorter or divided into nonstandard terms, disbursement schedules are adjusted accordingly.

5. Effect on Award Calculation: The calculation of Pell Grant awards considers the scheduled hours and weeks, which are influenced by the calendar structure. Nonstandard terms and subscription-based calendars can lead to adjustments in payment periods, affecting when students receive funds and the amount they are eligible for in each disbursement.

In summary, the non-term and subscription-based calendar structures, especially when they deviate from the defined academic year, impact the calculation and disbursement of Pell Grants by determining the specific payment periods based on scheduled hours and weeks, thereby affecting disbursement timing and amounts.","The structure of non-term and subscription-based academic calendars directly impacts the calculation and disbursement of Pell Grant awards in clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs. In non-term academic calendars, classes do not begin and end within a set timeframe, and academic progress can be measured in either credit or clock hours. For Pell Grant awards in these programs, the amount a student is eligible to receive for a payment period is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods established at the beginning of the program. These scheduled payment periods do not change, regardless of a student’s rate of progression. In subscription-based programs, which are a type of term-based program, Pell Grant awards are calculated using Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3, and the term 'subscription period' is synonymous with 'term' and 'payment period.' The rules for term-based programs also apply to subscription-based programs, including requirements for determining full-time enrollment and the use of specific academic year structures. Therefore, the academic calendar type determines both the method for calculating Pell Grant awards and the timing of disbursements under Title IV regulations.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

If a school chooses to schedule multiple Direct Loan disbursements within a single payment period, the disbursements must be substantially equal. Note also that if the loan period for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless the school qualifies for an exception to the multiple disbursement requirement. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more', '<2-hop>\n\nnon-term (includes clock-hour calendars), or subscription-based. In a standard term or nonstandard term academic calendar, a term is generally a period in which all classes are scheduled to begin and end within a set time frame, and academic progress is measured in credit hours. In a non-term academic calendar, classes do not begin and end within a set time frame, such as a term. Academic progress in a non-term program can be measured in either credit or clock hours. In some cases (as discussed below), a program with terms must be treated as a non-term program for Title IV purposes. A subscription-based academic calendar is used only by subscription-based programs. A subscription-based program is a term-based program in which the school charges a student for each term on a subscription basis with the expectation that the student will complete a specified number of credit hours (or the equivalent) during that term. However, classes in a subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term, as is the case in a term-based calendar that is not subscription-based. For more detail on subscription-based programs, see Volume 2, Chapter 2. A subscription-based academic calendar consists of ""subscription periods"" that are either standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms (for guidance on when terms are considered to be substantially equal in length, see <Payment periods for programs using standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms= later in this chapter). Substantially equal nonstandard terms may be of any length, but if they are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for purposes of monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6 for more information on BBAY 3). Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length are not permissible in a subscription-based academic calendar. The term ""subscription period"" is synonymous with ""term"" and ""payment period"" (payment periods are covered later in this chapter). Except for the fact that classes are not required to start and end within a term, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs. These requirements include: minimum and maximum term length restrictions for standard terms (see the discussion in the next section of this chapter); requirements for determining full-time enrollment (see Volume 1, Chapter 1); use of a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY), BBAY 1, BBAY 2, or BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6); and use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards (see Volume 7, Chapter 4). Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. Standard Terms: Semesters, Trimesters, and Quarters Semesters and trimesters contain between 14 and 21 weeks of instructional time. However, a summer term in a program using semesters or trimesters may contain fewer than 14 weeks. An academic calendar that uses semesters or trimesters traditionally has three terms, one each in the fall, spring, and summer, two of which comprise an academic year. For example, in a program using an SAY calendar, fall and spring would comprise an academic year. In a program using a']","In subscription-based programs, the requirements for disbursement timing and academic progress differ from those in standard term or non-term programs in several key ways:

Disbursement Timing:
- For the first two subscription periods (terms), students can receive disbursements without having completed a specific amount of coursework.
- Starting from the third subscription period, students must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total hours enrolled in all previous subscription periods (excluding hours for which they were not enrolled).
- Disbursements are delayed if the student has not met the cumulative credit hour requirement for that period. For example, if 72 hours are required for the eighth period but the student has only earned 69 hours, the disbursement is delayed until the student completes the additional hours.
- Once the student has earned the required hours (e.g., 84 hours for the ninth period), disbursements can be made at the beginning of that period.

Academic Progress Requirements:
- The program uses subscription periods that are not required to start and end within a traditional academic calendar, and classes are not required to start and end within a term.
- The program must define subscription periods as either standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms. If nonstandard terms are less than nine weeks and not substantially equal, BBAY 3 is used for monitoring.
- For monitoring Direct Loan limits, the program may use BBAY 2 (any two consecutive semesters) or BBAY 3, depending on the length and nature of the terms.
- There is no explicit coursework completion requirement for the first two subscription periods, but subsequent disbursements depend on meeting the cumulative credit hour requirements.

Summary:
- Subscription periods are treated as terms, but disbursement timing depends on cumulative credit hours.
- Disbursements for the initial periods are not contingent on coursework, but later disbursements require meeting progress benchmarks.
- Monitoring uses BBAY 2 or BBAY 3 based on term length and structure.
- Multiple disbursements within a payment period are managed based on progress, with delays if requirements are not met.

This approach ensures that disbursement timing aligns with student progress over multiple periods, differing from the more immediate disbursement schedules in standard calendars.","In subscription-based programs, as described in Volume 8, Chapter 6 and referenced in Volume 8, Chapter 3, the disbursement timing for Title IV aid differs from standard term or non-term academic calendars. For the first two subscription periods, students are not required to complete a certain amount of coursework before receiving Title IV funds, similar to other term-based programs using credit hours. However, for subsequent subscription periods, students must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods, excluding the most recent one, to receive further disbursements. Subscription-based programs use 'subscription periods,' which are synonymous with 'terms' or 'payment periods,' and these can be standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms. If nonstandard terms are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression. Additionally, schools may choose to make multiple disbursements within a payment period, but if they do so for Direct Loans, the disbursements must be substantially equal, and if the loan period is a single payment period, at least two installments are required unless an exception applies. These requirements ensure that aid is awarded and disbursed in accordance with the unique structure of subscription-based programs, as opposed to the more rigid timing and progress requirements in standard term or non-term calendars.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
