In a standard term or nonstandard term academic calendar, a term is generally a period in which all classes are scheduled to begin and end within a set time frame, and academic progress is measured in credit hours. In a non-term academic calendar, classes do not begin and end within a set time frame, such as a term. Academic progress in a non-term program can be measured in either credit or clock hours. In some cases (as discussed below), a program with terms must be treated as a non-term program for Title IV purposes. A subscription-based academic calendar is used only by subscription-based programs. A subscription-based program is a term-based program in which the school charges a student for each term on a subscription basis with the expectation that the student will complete a specified number of credit hours (or the equivalent) during that term. However, classes in a subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term, as is the case in a term-based calendar that is not subscription-based. For more detail on subscription-based programs, see Volume 2, Chapter 2. A subscription-based academic calendar consists of ""subscription periods"" that are either standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms (for guidance on when terms are considered to be substantially equal in length, see <Payment periods for programs using standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms= later in this chapter). Substantially equal nonstandard terms may be of any length, but if they are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for purposes of monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6 for more information on BBAY 3). Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length are not permissible in a subscription-based academic calendar. The term ""subscription period"" is synonymous with ""term"" and ""payment period"" (payment periods are covered later in this chapter). Except for the fact that classes are not required to start and end within a term, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs. These requirements include: minimum and maximum term length restrictions for standard terms (see the discussion in the next section of this chapter); requirements for determining full-time enrollment (see Volume 1, Chapter 1); use of a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY), BBAY 1, BBAY 2, or BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6); and use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards (see Volume 7, Chapter 4). Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. Standard Terms: Semesters, Trimesters, and Quarters Semesters and trimesters contain between 14 and 21 weeks of instructional time. However, a summer term in a program using semesters or trimesters may contain fewer than 14 weeks. An academic calendar that uses semesters or trimesters traditionally has three terms, one each in the fall, spring, and summer, two of which comprise an academic year. For example, in a program using an SAY calendar, fall and spring would comprise an academic year. In a program using a']","Title IV federal student aid interacts with different academic calendars—standard term, nonterm, and subscription-based—in specific ways, with procedures and requirements varying accordingly:

1. **Standard Term and Nonstandard Term Academic Calendars:**
   - These calendars are based on defined periods such as semesters, trimesters, or quarters, each with scheduled start and end dates.
   - Aid is awarded and disbursed based on these set terms, with academic progress measured in credit hours.
   - For programs using these calendars, the aid procedures involve aligning disbursements with the scheduled terms, and the academic year typically corresponds to the calendar structure (e.g., fall and spring terms forming an academic year).
   - The use of a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) or other monitoring periods (BBAY 1, BBAY 2, BBAY 3) is important for tracking loan limits and Pell Grant calculations.

2. **Non-term Academic Calendars:**
   - In non-term programs, classes do not have fixed start and end dates within a set period, and academic progress can be measured in credit or clock hours.
   - Aid procedures must accommodate the flexible scheduling, and disbursements are often tied to periods of attendance rather than specific terms.
   - If a program with terms is treated as non-term for Title IV purposes, the disbursement and progress monitoring procedures are adjusted accordingly, often focusing on hours completed rather than calendar dates.

3. **Subscription-Based Academic Calendars:**
   - Used exclusively by subscription-based programs, these calendars do not follow traditional term structures.
   - They have specific requirements, including minimum and maximum term lengths, and must adhere to certain rules for determining full-time enrollment, monitoring loan limits, and Pell Grant calculations.
   - Disbursement procedures are aligned with the subscription periods, and the use of SAY or similar periods is required for tracking aid eligibility and progress.
   - These programs must follow particular regulations outlined in 34 CFR 668.2(b), including the use of specific formulas for Pell Grants and loan limit monitoring.

**Differences in Procedures or Requirements:**
- **Timing of Disbursements:** In standard and nonstandard term calendars, disbursements are often tied to scheduled terms, whereas in non-term and subscription-based calendars, disbursements may be based on attendance or subscription periods.
- **Progress Monitoring:** Standard and nonstandard term programs typically measure progress in credit hours within defined terms, while non-term and subscription-based programs may measure in hours or subscription periods.
- **Use of Monitoring Periods:** Subscription-based programs require specific use of SAY or similar periods for loan and Pell Grant tracking, whereas traditional calendars rely on academic year or term-based periods.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Subscription-based programs have additional specific requirements, including minimum/maximum term lengths and formulas for aid calculations, which are not applicable to traditional term-based programs.

In summary, the type of academic calendar influences how Title IV aid is awarded, disbursed, and monitored, with each calendar type having tailored procedures to ensure compliance with federal regulations.","Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. For standard term or nonstandard term calendars, terms are periods where all classes start and end within a set timeframe, and progress is measured in credit hours. Non-term calendars don’t have set start and end times for classes, and progress can be measured in credit or clock hours. Sometimes, a program with terms must be treated as non-term for Title IV purposes. Subscription-based programs are term-based but charge students by subscription, and classes don’t have to start or end within a specific timeframe. The rules for term-based programs that aren’t subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs, including term length restrictions, full-time enrollment requirements, monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression, and Pell Grant formulas.

(Note: The scenario described here assumes that the term']","['Inclusion of Clinical Work in a Standard Term Periods of medical and education program clinical work which is conducted outside the classroom may not be included in a standard term, unless all of the following apply: All students in the program must participate in the practicum or clinical experience, and they must be required to complete the practicum or clinical experience as a condition for applying for licensure or authorization to practice the occupation they intend to pursue; The school has little or no control over the length or starting and ending dates of the practicum or clinical experience. This may be due to constraints imposed by outside licensing bodies or the need to accommodate schedules of entities with which students are being placed (e.g., school districts or hospitals); and Credit hours associated with the practicum or clinical experience must be associated with the term in which most of the training occurs, even if the starting and ending dates do not exactly align with the term dates and/or overlap with another term. If the clinical work meets all the above criteria, terms which include such clinical work are not required to be considered nonstandard, nor are such programs required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. This flexibility is limited to required clinical periods associated with standard term programs in medicine (including, but not limited to, allopathic, osteopathic, nursing, veterinary, dentistry, pharmacy, and physical therapy), and student teaching required to obtain a state teaching certificate. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for additional guidance on certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets the criteria described above is included in a standard term. Nonstandard Terms Generally, nonstandard terms are terms that are not semesters, trimesters, or quarters. For example, a 5-week term or a 23-week term would be considered a nonstandard term because no standard term can be fewer than nine weeks or greater than 21 weeks in length. Like standard terms, nonstandard terms may be equal in length or may be of different lengths. If a program is offered in a combination of standard terms and nonstandard terms, the program is considered to be offered in nonstandard terms. Also, like standard terms, nonstandard terms may not overlap within a program. Even if a school calls its terms semesters, trimesters, or quarters, they are considered to be nonstandard terms if they do not comply with the policy on standard term length, as described earlier. For instance, a 22-week semester or an 8-week quarter must be treated as a nonstandard term, because a semester cannot contain more than 21 weeks and a quarter must include a minimum of nine weeks. Semesters, trimesters, or quarters are also considered to be nonstandard terms if academic progress is not measured in the manner normally associated with the type of term. For example, if a program is offered in 15-week semesters but measures academic progress in quarter credit hours, the semesters would be considered nonstandard terms.']","According to Volume 8, Chapter 3, the specific exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans occur when clinical work that meets certain criteria is included in a standard term. In such cases:

- The school must associate the clinical work with the term during which the majority of the clinical work occurs.
- If a student receives a Direct Loan for a term that includes clinical work, and the clinical work begins before the official start date of that term, the loan period start date is set to the beginning date of the clinical work, rather than the term's start date.
- For disbursements, if a subsequent term includes clinical work that has not yet started when the term begins, the second or subsequent disbursement can be made no earlier than 10 days before the clinical work begins, rather than the usual 10 days before the start of the term.

This guidance provides flexibility in the timing of loan disbursements for programs with required clinical or practicum experiences. It ensures that disbursements can be aligned more closely with the actual start of clinical work, facilitating compliance with program requirements and supporting students in clinical-based programs.","Volume 8, Chapter 3 provides additional guidance on certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets the specified criteria is included in a standard term. Specifically, if all students in a program must participate in a practicum or clinical experience as a condition for licensure, the school has little or no control over the length or dates of the clinical experience, and the credit hours are associated with the term in which most training occurs, then the terms including such clinical work are not required to be considered nonstandard, nor are the programs required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. This flexibility applies to required clinical periods in standard term programs in fields such as medicine, nursing, veterinary, dentistry, pharmacy, physical therapy, and student teaching for state certification. Therefore, federal student aid administrators can continue to treat these programs as standard term for loan period and disbursement purposes, following the exceptions outlined in Volume 8, Chapter 3.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer

Effect of Accelerated Progression on Disbursement Timing in a Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Program The Pell Grant or TEACH Grant amount that a student is eligible to receive for a payment period in a clock-hour or non- term credit-hour program is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods for the program that are established at the beginning of the program based on the program length (as described earlier in this chapter).

In this circumstance, the Direct Loan annual loan limit for an undergraduate student must be prorated (reduced).

Effect of Accelerated Progression on Disbursement Timing in a Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Program The Pell Grant or TEACH Grant amount that a student is eligible to receive for a payment period in a clock-hour or non- term credit-hour program is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods for the program that are established at the beginning of the program based on the program length (as described earlier in this chapter). These scheduled payment periods do not change, regardless of a student9s rate of progression through a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program. This means that if a student completes additional weeks of instructional time or hours while completing the other measure of a payment period, the actual number of weeks or hours that the student completes before a disbursement can be made for the next payment period may differ from the number of weeks or hours in the scheduled payment period used to determine the student9s grant amount for the payment period. Although a student9s completion of additional weeks or hours in a payment period has no effect on the scheduled payment periods for purposes of determining Pell Grant and TEACH Grant payment amounts, an undergraduate student who accelerates in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year of a program. Specifically, if a student enrolled in a program that is greater than one academic year in length completes additional clock or credit hours prior to the final academic year of the program, this may result in a final period of study that contains fewer clock or credit hours than the number of hours in the program9s defined academic year. In this circumstance, the Direct Loan annual loan limit for an undergraduate student must be prorated (reduced). The principles described above are illustrated by the examples in Appendix A at the end of this chapter. For guidance on calculating Pell Grant and TEACH Grant awards for clock-hour and non-term credit-hour programs, see Volume 7. For information on Direct Loan annual loan limit proration and annual loan limit progression in clock-hour and non-term credit- hour programs, see Volume 8, Chapters 5 and 6. If your school is unable to determine when a student has successfully completed half of the credit or clock hours in a program, academic year, or remainder of a program, the student is considered to have begun the second payment period of the program, academic year, or remainder of a program at the later of the date (identified by your school) that the student has successfully completed: half of the academic coursework in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program; or half of the number of weeks of instructional time in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program.', '<2-hop>\n\nDisbursement Timing in Subscription-Based Programs For the first two subscription periods (terms) that a student attends in a subscription-based program, there is no requirement for the student to have completed a certain amount of coursework before receiving a disbursement of Title IV funds (the same as in any other term-based program using credit hours). However, to receive a disbursement of Title IV aid for each subsequent subscription period in the program, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods in the program, excluding the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in the most recently attended subscription period. For more detailed guidance on the disbursement rules for subscription-based programs, including examples, refer to Appendix B at the end of this chapter. Multiple Disbursements Within a Payment Period The regulations governing the Title IV programs generally permit schools to pay Title IV funds at such times and in such installments within each payment period as will best meet students9 needs. This gives schools the ability to apportion the payment if doing so will be in the best interest of the student. For example, if a payment period is particularly long, a school might choose to pay in multiple installments to the extent program requirements permit to ensure that a student will have funds to pay rent later in the payment period. If a school chooses to schedule multiple Direct Loan disbursements within a single payment period, the disbursements must be substantially equal. Note also that if the loan period for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless the school qualifies for an exception to the multiple disbursement requirement. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more']","The disbursement timing for federal student aid varies between clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs and subscription-based programs:

- **Clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs:**  
  Disbursements are based on the student's successful completion of the scheduled clock hours and weeks of instructional time. A student must complete the required hours and weeks before receiving a disbursement for the next payment period. Payment periods are defined by the successful completion of these hours and weeks, and disbursements are made accordingly.

- **Subscription-based programs:**  
  For the first two subscription periods, a school can disburse Title IV funds up to 10 days before the start of the period. Starting with the third subscription period, early disbursement (10 days before the period begins) is only permitted if the student has already completed the required credit hours for that period. If not, disbursement cannot occur until the student meets the coursework completion requirement.

In summary, clock-hour and non-term programs disburse aid based on completion of hours and weeks, while subscription-based programs have a more flexible disbursement schedule that depends on coursework completion, especially after the initial periods.","In clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs, students must complete both the required credit or clock hours and weeks of instructional time in a payment period before receiving a disbursement of Pell Grant, FSEOG, TEACH Grant, or Direct Loan funds for the next payment period. In contrast, in subscription-based programs, for the first two subscription periods, there is no requirement for the student to complete a certain amount of coursework before receiving a disbursement of Title IV funds. However, for each subsequent subscription period, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total of the hours enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods, excluding the most recent one.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer

If the clinical work meets all the above criteria, terms which include such clinical work are not required to be considered nonstandard, nor are such programs required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. This flexibility is limited to required clinical periods associated with standard term programs in medicine (including, but not limited to, allopathic, osteopathic, nursing, veterinary, dentistry, pharmacy, and physical therapy), and student teaching required to obtain a state teaching certificate. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for additional guidance on certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets the criteria described above is included in a standard term. Nonstandard Terms Generally, nonstandard terms are terms that are not semesters, trimesters, or quarters. For example, a 5-week term or a 23-week term would be considered a nonstandard term because no standard term can be fewer than nine weeks or greater than 21 weeks in length. Like standard terms, nonstandard terms may be equal in length or may be of different lengths. If a program is offered in a combination of standard terms and nonstandard terms, the program is considered to be offered in nonstandard terms. Also, like standard terms, nonstandard terms may not overlap within a program. Even if a school calls its terms semesters, trimesters, or quarters, they are considered to be nonstandard terms if they do not comply with the policy on standard term length, as described earlier. For instance, a 22-week semester or an 8-week quarter must be treated as a nonstandard term, because a semester cannot contain more than 21 weeks and a quarter must include a minimum of nine weeks. Semesters, trimesters, or quarters are also considered to be nonstandard terms if academic progress is not measured in the manner normally associated with the type of term. For example, if a program is offered in 15-week semesters but measures academic progress in quarter credit hours, the semesters would be considered nonstandard terms.', '<2-hop>\n\nNon-Term Characteristics A program that measures progress in clock hours is always treated as a non-term program.

For example, Title IV program disbursements (except FWS payments) must be made on a payment period basis, as discussed in detail']","The requirement of a practicum or clinical experience for licensure does not automatically classify a program with non-term characteristics as a non-term program. According to the guidelines, if all students are required to participate in the practicum or clinical experience as a condition for licensure or practice, and the clinical work meets specific criteria—such as being conducted outside the classroom, with limited control over its timing, and credit hours associated with the most training occurring within a term—then the program can still be considered a standard term program. 

The key conditions include:
- All students must participate in the clinical experience for licensure.
- The school has little or no control over the start and end dates of the clinical work.
- The clinical work is scheduled outside the classroom and overlaps with the term.
- Credit hours associated with the clinical experience are linked to the term in which most of the training occurs.

In a standard term or nonstandard term academic calendar, a term is generally a period in which all classes are scheduled to begin and end within a set time frame, and academic progress is measured in credit hours. In a non-term academic calendar, classes do not begin and end within a set time frame, such as a term. Academic progress in a non-term program can be measured in either credit or clock hours. In some cases (as discussed below), a program with terms must be treated as a non-term program for Title IV purposes. A subscription-based academic calendar is used only by subscription-based programs. A subscription-based program is a term-based program in which the school charges a student for each term on a subscription basis with the expectation that the student will complete a specified number of credit hours (or the equivalent) during that term. However, classes in a subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term, as is the case in a term-based calendar that is not subscription-based. For more detail on subscription-based programs, see Volume 2, Chapter 2. A subscription-based academic calendar consists of ""subscription periods"" that are either standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms (for guidance on when terms are considered to be substantially equal in length, see <Payment periods for programs using standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms= later in this chapter). Substantially equal nonstandard terms may be of any length, but if they are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for purposes of monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6 for more information on BBAY 3). Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length are not permissible in a subscription-based academic calendar. The term ""subscription period"" is synonymous with ""term"" and ""payment period"" (payment periods are covered later in this chapter). Except for the fact that classes are not required to start and end within a term, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs. These requirements include: minimum and maximum term length restrictions for standard terms (see the discussion in the next section of this chapter); requirements for determining full-time enrollment (see Volume 1, Chapter 1); use of a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY), BBAY 1, BBAY 2, or BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6); and use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards (see Volume 7, Chapter 4). Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. Standard Terms: Semesters, Trimesters, and Quarters Semesters and trimesters contain between 14 and 21 weeks of instructional time. However, a summer term in a program using semesters or trimesters may contain fewer than 14 weeks. An academic calendar that uses semesters or trimesters traditionally has three terms, one each in the fall, spring, and summer, two of which comprise an academic year. For example, in a program using an SAY calendar, fall and spring would comprise an academic year.

However, to receive a disbursement of Title IV aid for each subsequent subscription period in the program, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods in the program, excluding the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in the most recently attended subscription period. For more detailed guidance on the disbursement rules for subscription-based programs, including examples, refer to Appendix B at the end of this chapter. Multiple Disbursements Within a Payment Period The regulations governing the Title IV programs generally permit schools to pay Title IV funds at such times and in such installments within each payment period as will best meet students9 needs. This gives schools the ability to apportion the payment if doing so will be in the best interest of the student. For example, if a payment period is particularly long, a school might choose to pay in multiple installments to the extent program requirements permit to ensure that a student will have funds to pay rent later in the payment period. If a school chooses to schedule multiple Direct Loan disbursements within a single payment period, the disbursements must be substantially equal. Note also that if the loan period for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless the school qualifies for an exception to the multiple disbursement requirement. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more']","A subscription-based academic calendar affects the timing of disbursement for Title IV aid in the following ways:

- For the first two subscription periods in the program, a school can make a disbursement of Title IV funds up to 10 days before the beginning of each subscription period, regardless of coursework completion.
- Starting with the third subscription period, early disbursement (10 days before the start) is only permitted if the student has completed the required number of credit hours to qualify for the disbursement at that point.
- If the student has not met the coursework completion requirement by the start of the third or subsequent subscription periods, the school cannot disburse funds until the student has completed the necessary credit hours.
- The timing of disbursements is also influenced by the cumulative hours associated with each subscription period, which determine when a student becomes eligible for disbursement based on coursework completion.

For students to receive disbursements in later subscription periods, they must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total hours for which they were enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods, excluding the hours for the most recently attended period. This ensures that students meet the coursework completion requirements before receiving additional disbursements.","in a subscription-based academic calendar, which is used only by subscription-based programs, the timing of title iv aid disbursement is affected by specific requirements. for the first two subscription periods (terms) that a student attends, there is no requirement for the student to have completed a certain amount of coursework before receiving a disbursement of title iv funds, similar to other term-based programs using credit hours. however, for each subsequent subscription period, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods, excluding the most recently attended subscription period. this means that after the first two periods, students must demonstrate completion of prior enrolled credit hours to continue receiving disbursements. additionally, schools may choose to make multiple, substantially equal disbursements within a payment period to best meet students' needs, and if a direct loan period is a single payment period, it must be disbursed in at least two installments unless an exception applies.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer

For example, Title IV program disbursements (except FWS payments) must be made on a payment period basis, as discussed in detail']","Based on the information from StudentAid.gov, a program that includes practicum or clinical experience required for licensure, which does not have a set start or end date, is generally considered a non-term or nonstandard term program. Non-term programs are characterized by their measurement of progress using clock-hours or credit-hours rather than traditional academic calendar terms like semesters or quarters. They are not bound to a specific academic calendar, which aligns with programs that have flexible start and end dates for clinical or practicum components.

Regarding federal aid payment periods, non-term programs influence how payment periods are established. For these programs, payment periods are based on credit hours and weeks of instruction rather than standard semester or quarter structures. Pell Grants for non-term programs use specific formulas (such as Formula 4) to determine the award amount, and the payment periods depend on the structure of the program, including its length and the way progress is measured.

In summary:
- The program is considered non-term or nonstandard term due to its flexible start/end dates and measurement by clock-hours or credit-hours.
- Non-term characteristics affect federal aid payment periods by making them based on credit hours and instructional weeks, rather than traditional academic terms, and specific Pell Grant formulas are applied accordingly.","if the practicum or clinical experience is required for licensure and all students must do it, and the school got little control over the timing, it can still be included in a standard term if the credit hours are put in the term where most training happens, even if dates overlap. but if the program got courses that don’t begin and end in a set period like a term, or courses that overlap terms, then it is considered a non-term program. for non-term programs, payment periods apply to all Title IV programs except Federal Work-Study, and disbursements must be made on a payment period basis.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer

However, to receive a disbursement of Title IV aid for each subsequent subscription period in the program, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods in the program, excluding the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in the most recently attended subscription period. For more detailed guidance on the disbursement rules for subscription-based programs, including examples, refer to Appendix B at the end of this chapter. Multiple Disbursements Within a Payment Period The regulations governing the Title IV programs generally permit schools to pay Title IV funds at such times and in such installments within each payment period as will best meet students9 needs. This gives schools the ability to apportion the payment if doing so will be in the best interest of the student. For example, if a payment period is particularly long, a school might choose to pay in multiple installments to the extent program requirements permit to ensure that a student will have funds to pay rent later in the payment period. If a school chooses to schedule multiple Direct Loan disbursements within a single payment period, the disbursements must be substantially equal. Note also that if the loan period for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless the school qualifies for an exception to the multiple disbursement requirement.

In a standard term or nonstandard term academic calendar, a term is generally a period in which all classes are scheduled to begin and end within a set time frame, and academic progress is measured in credit hours. In a non-term academic calendar, classes do not begin and end within a set time frame, such as a term. Academic progress in a non-term program can be measured in either credit or clock hours. In some cases (as discussed below), a program with terms must be treated as a non-term program for Title IV purposes. A subscription-based academic calendar is used only by subscription-based programs. A subscription-based program is a term-based program in which the school charges a student for each term on a subscription basis with the expectation that the student will complete a specified number of credit hours (or the equivalent) during that term. However, classes in a subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term, as is the case in a term-based calendar that is not subscription-based. For more detail on subscription-based programs, see Volume 2, Chapter 2. A subscription-based academic calendar consists of ""subscription periods"" that are either standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms (for guidance on when terms are considered to be substantially equal in length, see <Payment periods for programs using standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms= later in this chapter). Substantially equal nonstandard terms may be of any length, but if they are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for purposes of monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6 for more information on BBAY 3). Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length are not permissible in a subscription-based academic calendar. The term ""subscription period"" is synonymous with ""term"" and ""payment period"" (payment periods are covered later in this chapter). Except for the fact that classes are not required to start and end within a term, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs. These requirements include: minimum and maximum term length restrictions for standard terms (see the discussion in the next section of this chapter); requirements for determining full-time enrollment (see Volume 1, Chapter 1); use of a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY), BBAY 1, BBAY 2, or BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6); and use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards (see Volume 7, Chapter 4). Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. Standard Terms: Semesters, Trimesters, and Quarters Semesters and trimesters contain between 14 and 21 weeks of instructional time. However, a summer term in a program using semesters or trimesters may contain fewer than 14 weeks. An academic calendar that uses semesters or trimesters traditionally has three terms, one each in the fall, spring, and summer, two of which comprise an academic year. For example, in a program using an SAY calendar, fall and spring would comprise an academic year. In a program using a']","The structure of a subscription-based academic calendar affects the timing and eligibility for Title IV disbursements by establishing specific credit hour completion requirements for each subscription period. According to the information from Volume 2, Chapter 2, and Volume 8, Chapter 3:

- In the first and second subscription periods, students are eligible for disbursement without having completed any coursework.
- Starting from the third subscription period, students must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total hours enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods, excluding the most recent one.
- For example, to receive aid in the third period, the student must have completed the hours from the first period; for the fourth, the total from the first and second periods; and so on.
- This cumulative requirement continues until the total hours in the program are reached, at which point the student becomes ineligible for further disbursements.
- The disbursement rules are designed to ensure that students demonstrate progress through the program before receiving additional aid, with eligibility contingent upon meeting these cumulative credit hour thresholds.

This structure ensures that disbursements are aligned with the student's progress, preventing aid from being disbursed if the student has not completed the necessary coursework in prior periods.","The structurre of a subscription-based academic calendar, as described in Volume 2, Chapter 2 and referenced in Volume 8, Chapter 3, directly impacts the timing and eligibility for Title IV disbursements. In subscription-based programs, the academic calendar is divided into 'subscription periods,' which are synonymous with terms or payment periods. For the first two subscription periods that a student attends, there is no requirement for the student to have completed a certain amount of coursework before receiving a disbursement of Title IV funds. However, for each subsequent subscription period, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods, excluding the most recently attended period. This means that after the initial two periods, continued eligibility for disbursement is contingent upon the student’s academic progress as measured by completed credit hours. The rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs, except that classes in a subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term. These requirements, including minimum and maximum term lengths and the use of specific Pell Grant formulas and Direct Loan annual loan limit progression methods, are detailed in the referenced volumes and chapters.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

For the Direct Loan Program only, this same requirement applies to students who are enrolled in programs with nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length. Effect of Accelerated Progression on Disbursement Timing in a Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Program The Pell Grant or TEACH Grant amount that a student is eligible to receive for a payment period in a clock-hour or non- term credit-hour program is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods for the program that are established at the beginning of the program based on the program length (as described earlier in this chapter). These scheduled payment periods do not change, regardless of a student9s rate of progression through a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program. This means that if a student completes additional weeks of instructional time or hours while completing the other measure of a payment period, the actual number of weeks or hours that the student completes before a disbursement can be made for the next payment period may differ from the number of weeks or hours in the scheduled payment period used to determine the student9s grant amount for the payment period. Although a student9s completion of additional weeks or hours in a payment period has no effect on the scheduled payment periods for purposes of determining Pell Grant and TEACH Grant payment amounts, an undergraduate student who accelerates in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year of a program. Specifically, if a student enrolled in a program that is greater than one academic year in length completes additional clock or credit hours prior to the final academic year of the program, this may result in a final period of study that contains fewer clock or credit hours than the number of hours in the program9s defined academic year. In this circumstance, the Direct Loan annual loan limit for an undergraduate student must be prorated (reduced). The principles described above are illustrated by the examples in Appendix A at the end of this chapter. For guidance on calculating Pell Grant and TEACH Grant awards for clock-hour and non-term credit-hour programs, see Volume 7. For information on Direct Loan annual loan limit proration and annual loan limit progression in clock-hour and non-term credit- hour programs, see Volume 8, Chapters 5 and 6. If your school is unable to determine when a student has successfully completed half of the credit or clock hours in a program, academic year, or remainder of a program, the student is considered to have begun the second payment period of the program, academic year, or remainder of a program at the later of the date (identified by your school) that the student has successfully completed: half of the academic coursework in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program; or half of the number of weeks of instructional time in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program.']","If a student is in a non-term or subscription-based program and finishes classes faster than normal, the way Direct Loans work is as follows:

- The school originates a single-term loan for each subscription period, with the loan period dates matching the start and end dates of that subscription period.
- Disbursements are made at the beginning of each subscription period if the student meets the course completion requirements.
- If the student completes the program earlier than the scheduled end of the subscription period, the disbursement schedule remains based on the original subscription periods; the student continues to receive disbursements at the start of each period as long as they meet the requirements.
- For remaining periods of study that are shorter than an academic year, the total loan amount is prorated based on the remaining hours or length of the period.
- If the student finishes classes early, they may receive disbursements for the remaining subscription periods until the program is complete, but no additional disbursements are made beyond the scheduled periods unless the student re-enrolls or the program length changes.

In summary, even if a student finishes early, the disbursement schedule for Direct Loans in a non-term or subscription-based program continues according to the original subscription periods, with prorated limits applied if the remaining period is shorter than a full academic year.","if student in non-term or subscription-based program and finish classes faster, the scheduled payment periods for direct loan do not change, but if student completes extra hours before final academic year, the last period may have less hours and the direct loan annual loan limit must be reduced (prorated).",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

This may be due to constraints imposed by outside licensing bodies or the need to accommodate schedules of entities with which students are being placed (e.g., school districts or hospitals); and Credit hours associated with the practicum or clinical experience must be associated with the term in which most of the training occurs, even if the starting and ending dates do not exactly align with the term dates and/or overlap with another term. If the clinical work meets all the above criteria, terms which include such clinical work are not required to be considered nonstandard, nor are such programs required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. This flexibility is limited to required clinical periods associated with standard term programs in medicine (including, but not limited to, allopathic, osteopathic, nursing, veterinary, dentistry, pharmacy, and physical therapy), and student teaching required to obtain a state teaching certificate. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for additional guidance on certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets the criteria described above is included in a standard term. Nonstandard Terms Generally, nonstandard terms are terms that are not semesters, trimesters, or quarters. For example, a 5-week term or a 23-week term would be considered a nonstandard term because no standard term can be fewer than nine weeks or greater than 21 weeks in length. Like standard terms, nonstandard terms may be equal in length or may be of different lengths. If a program is offered in a combination of standard terms and nonstandard terms, the program is considered to be offered in nonstandard terms. Also, like standard terms, nonstandard terms may not overlap within a program. Even if a school calls its terms semesters, trimesters, or quarters, they are considered to be nonstandard terms if they do not comply with the policy on standard term length, as described earlier. For instance, a 22-week semester or an 8-week quarter must be treated as a nonstandard term, because a semester cannot contain more than 21 weeks and a quarter must include a minimum of nine weeks. Semesters, trimesters, or quarters are also considered to be nonstandard terms if academic progress is not measured in the manner normally associated with the type of term. For example, if a program is offered in 15-week semesters but measures academic progress in quarter credit hours, the semesters would be considered nonstandard terms.']","Clinical work and accelerated progression can influence the timing of Direct Loan disbursements for students in a nonstandard term program. Specifically, if clinical work meets the criteria to be included in a standard or SE9W nonstandard term, the school must associate the clinical work with the term during which most of the clinical work occurs. 

When clinical work begins before the start date of the associated term, the loan period start date is set to the beginning date of the clinical work, rather than the term's start date. Additionally, if a loan period includes multiple terms and a subsequent term's clinical work has not yet started when that term begins, the second or subsequent disbursement can only be made no earlier than 10 days before the clinical work begins, rather than the usual 10 days before the start of the term.

In summary, clinical work and accelerated progression can delay the timing of loan disbursements, ensuring that disbursements are aligned with the actual start of clinical activities, especially when clinical work begins before the official start of the associated term.","If a student in a nonstandard term program receives a Direct Loan, clinical work that meets specific criteria (such as being required for licensure and having little or no school control over its schedule) can be included in a standard term, and exceptions to normal Direct Loan disbursement timing may apply. However, if the student accelerates their progression in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program, they may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year. This is because completing additional hours before the final year can result in a final period with fewer hours than the defined academic year, requiring the Direct Loan annual loan limit to be prorated (reduced).",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

A subscription-based program is a term-based program in which the school charges a student for each term on a subscription basis with the expectation that the student will complete a specified number of credit hours (or the equivalent) during that term. However, classes in a subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term, as is the case in a term-based calendar that is not subscription-based. For more detail on subscription-based programs, see Volume 2, Chapter 2. A subscription-based academic calendar consists of ""subscription periods"" that are either standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms (for guidance on when terms are considered to be substantially equal in length, see <Payment periods for programs using standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms= later in this chapter). Substantially equal nonstandard terms may be of any length, but if they are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for purposes of monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6 for more information on BBAY 3). Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length are not permissible in a subscription-based academic calendar. The term ""subscription period"" is synonymous with ""term"" and ""payment period"" (payment periods are covered later in this chapter). Except for the fact that classes are not required to start and end within a term, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs. These requirements include: minimum and maximum term length restrictions for standard terms (see the discussion in the next section of this chapter); requirements for determining full-time enrollment (see Volume 1, Chapter 1); use of a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY), BBAY 1, BBAY 2, or BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6); and use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards (see Volume 7, Chapter 4). Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. Standard Terms: Semesters, Trimesters, and Quarters Semesters and trimesters contain between 14 and 21 weeks of instructional time. However, a summer term in a program using semesters or trimesters may contain fewer than 14 weeks. An academic calendar that uses semesters or trimesters traditionally has three terms, one each in the fall, spring, and summer, two of which comprise an academic year. For example, in a program using an SAY calendar, fall and spring would comprise an academic year. In a program using a', '<2-hop>\n\nInclusion of Clinical Work in a Standard Term Periods of medical and education program clinical work which is conducted outside the classroom may not be included in a standard term, unless all of the following apply: All students in the program must participate in the practicum or clinical experience, and they must be required to complete the practicum or clinical experience as a condition for applying for licensure or authorization to practice the occupation they intend to pursue; The school has little or no control over the length or starting and ending dates of the practicum or clinical experience. This may be due to constraints imposed by outside licensing bodies or the need to accommodate schedules of entities with which students are being placed (e.g., school districts or hospitals); and Credit hours associated with the practicum or clinical experience must be associated with the term in which most of the training occurs, even if the starting and ending dates do not exactly align with the term dates and/or overlap with another term. If the clinical work meets all the above criteria, terms which include such clinical work are not required to be considered nonstandard, nor are such programs required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. This flexibility is limited to required clinical periods associated with standard term programs in medicine (including, but not limited to, allopathic, osteopathic, nursing, veterinary, dentistry, pharmacy, and physical therapy), and student teaching required to obtain a state teaching certificate. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for additional guidance on certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets the criteria described above is included in a standard term. Nonstandard Terms Generally, nonstandard terms are terms that are not semesters, trimesters, or quarters. For example, a 5-week term or a 23-week term would be considered a nonstandard term because no standard term can be fewer than nine weeks or greater than 21 weeks in length. Like standard terms, nonstandard terms may be equal in length or may be of different lengths. If a program is offered in a combination of standard terms and nonstandard terms, the program is considered to be offered in nonstandard terms. Also, like standard terms, nonstandard terms may not overlap within a program. Even if a school calls its terms semesters, trimesters, or quarters, they are considered to be nonstandard terms if they do not comply with the policy on standard term length, as described earlier. For instance, a 22-week semester or an 8-week quarter must be treated as a nonstandard term, because a semester cannot contain more than 21 weeks and a quarter must include a minimum of nine weeks. Semesters, trimesters, or quarters are also considered to be nonstandard terms if academic progress is not measured in the manner normally associated with the type of term. For example, if a program is offered in 15-week semesters but measures academic progress in quarter credit hours, the semesters would be considered nonstandard terms.']","The information about subscription-based programs and exceptions for clinical work in standard terms is related to how federal student aid disburses funds for clinical work in non-term programs, especially when the program uses non-standard terms. 

The relevant details are found in federal regulations and reports, such as the section in the Federal Register (see the link to the document from studentaid.gov) which discusses the disbursement rules based on academic terms and exceptions for substantially equal length terms.

However, specific chapters or volumes are not explicitly mentioned in the search results. The key regulatory reference is in the Federal Register, which is linked in the first result.
