In a standard term or nonstandard term academic calendar, a term is generally a period in which all classes are scheduled to begin and end within a set time frame, and academic progress is measured in credit hours. In a non-term academic calendar, classes do not begin and end within a set time frame, such as a term. Academic progress in a non-term program can be measured in either credit or clock hours. In some cases (as discussed below), a program with terms must be treated as a non-term program for Title IV purposes. A subscription-based academic calendar is used only by subscription-based programs. A subscription-based program is a term-based program in which the school charges a student for each term on a subscription basis with the expectation that the student will complete a specified number of credit hours (or the equivalent) during that term. However, classes in a subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term, as is the case in a term-based calendar that is not subscription-based. For more detail on subscription-based programs, see Volume 2, Chapter 2. A subscription-based academic calendar consists of ""subscription periods"" that are either standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms (for guidance on when terms are considered to be substantially equal in length, see <Payment periods for programs using standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms= later in this chapter). Substantially equal nonstandard terms may be of any length, but if they are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for purposes of monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6 for more information on BBAY 3). Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length are not permissible in a subscription-based academic calendar. The term ""subscription period"" is synonymous with ""term"" and ""payment period"" (payment periods are covered later in this chapter). Except for the fact that classes are not required to start and end within a term, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs. These requirements include: minimum and maximum term length restrictions for standard terms (see the discussion in the next section of this chapter); requirements for determining full-time enrollment (see Volume 1, Chapter 1); use of a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY), BBAY 1, BBAY 2, or BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6); and use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards (see Volume 7, Chapter 4). Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. Standard Terms: Semesters, Trimesters, and Quarters Semesters and trimesters contain between 14 and 21 weeks of instructional time. However, a summer term in a program using semesters or trimesters may contain fewer than 14 weeks. An academic calendar that uses semesters or trimesters traditionally has three terms, one each in the fall, spring, and summer, two of which comprise an academic year. For example, in a program using an SAY calendar, fall and spring would comprise an academic year. In a program using a']","Pell Grant awards are primarily based on financial need, FAFSA completion, and enrollment status. For students enrolled in subscription-based academic calendars, the calculation considers the total number of enrolled days or weeks rather than traditional semester or quarter terms. Pell Grant recipients can receive up to 100% of their award each academic year, and the total lifetime eligibility is limited to the equivalent of 12 school terms, which is roughly six years. The specific amount awarded depends on the student's financial need and enrollment status, regardless of the academic calendar structure.","For students in subscription-based academic calendars, Pell Grant awards are calculated using Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3, as described in Volume 7, Chapter 4.

Nonstandard Terms Generally, nonstandard terms are terms that are not semesters, trimesters, or quarters. For example, a 5-week term or a 23-week term would be considered a nonstandard term because no standard term can be fewer than nine weeks or greater than 21 weeks in length. Like standard terms, nonstandard terms may be equal in length or may be of different lengths. If a program is offered in a combination of standard terms and nonstandard terms, the program is considered to be offered in nonstandard terms. Also, like standard terms, nonstandard terms may not overlap within a program. Even if a school calls its terms semesters, trimesters, or quarters, they are considered to be nonstandard terms if they do not comply with the policy on standard term length, as described earlier. For instance, a 22-week semester or an 8-week quarter must be treated as a nonstandard term, because a semester cannot contain more than 21 weeks and a quarter must include a minimum of nine weeks. Semesters, trimesters, or quarters are also considered to be nonstandard terms if academic progress is not measured in the manner normally associated with the type of term. For example, if a program is offered in 15-week semesters but measures academic progress in quarter credit hours, the semesters would be considered nonstandard terms.']","Yes, veterinary clinical experiences are allowed to be included in standard term periods for financial aid purposes if they meet certain criteria.

Effect of Accelerated Progression on Disbursement Timing in a Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Program The Pell Grant or TEACH Grant amount that a student is eligible to receive for a payment period in a clock-hour or non- term credit-hour program is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods for the program that are established at the beginning of the program based on the program length (as described earlier in this chapter).

However, to receive a disbursement of Title IV aid for each subsequent subscription period in the program, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods in the program, excluding the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in the most recently attended subscription period.

Multiple Disbursements Within a Payment Period The regulations governing the Title IV programs generally permit schools to pay Title IV funds at such times and in such installments within each payment period as will best meet students9 needs. This gives schools the ability to apportion the payment if doing so will be in the best interest of the student. For example, if a payment period is particularly long, a school might choose to pay in multiple installments to the extent program requirements permit to ensure that a student will have funds to pay rent later in the payment period. If a school chooses to schedule multiple Direct Loan disbursements within a single payment period, the disbursements must be substantially equal. Note also that if the loan period for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless the school qualifies for an exception to the multiple disbursement requirement. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more']","The disbursement timing rules for federal student aid differ between clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs and subscription-based programs primarily in terms of when students become eligible for their next disbursement.

For clock-hour and non-term credit-hour programs:
- Students must successfully complete the required clock or credit hours and weeks of instructional time before receiving a disbursement for the next payment period.
- Disbursements are based on the student's successful completion of coursework associated with those hours.
- Payment periods are defined based on successful completion of clock or credit hours and weeks of instruction.
- For students enrolled in programs without academic terms, disbursements are tied to the completion of these hours and weeks.

For subscription-based programs:
- The number of hours associated with each term are added cumulatively to determine eligibility.
- For the first two subscription periods, schools can disburse funds up to 10 days before the start of the period.
- Starting with the third period, early disbursement is only permitted if the student has completed the required coursework hours for that period.
- If the student has not completed the required hours, disbursement cannot occur until the coursework completion requirement is met.

In summary:
- **Clock-hour/non-term credit-hour programs:** Eligibility for the next disbursement depends on successful completion of the required hours and weeks.
- **Subscription-based programs:** Early disbursements are allowed up to 10 days before the period begins for the first two periods; from the third period onward, disbursement depends on coursework completion.

Therefore, the payment periods for clock-hour\\nprograms that a school divides into terms are determined in the same way as described above under <Payment Periods\\nfor Clock-Hour and Non-Term Programs.= Because a student enrolled in such a program must successfully complete all the\\nclock hours in the payment period before the next payment period begins, the payment period starting dates may not\\ncoincide with the starting dates of the terms in the program.']","['<1-hop>\n\nboth the credit or clock hours and the weeks of instructional time in a payment period before receiving a disbursement of Pell Grant, FSEOG, TEACH Grant or Direct Loan funds for the next payment period. For the Direct Loan Program only, this same requirement applies to students who are enrolled in programs with nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length. Effect of Accelerated Progression on Disbursement Timing in a Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Program The Pell Grant or TEACH Grant amount that a student is eligible to receive for a payment period in a clock-hour or non- term credit-hour program is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods for the program that are established at the beginning of the program based on the program length (as described earlier in this chapter). These scheduled payment periods do not change, regardless of a student9s rate of progression through a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program. This means that if a student completes additional weeks of instructional time or hours while completing the other measure of a payment period, the actual number of weeks or hours that the student completes before a disbursement can be made for the next payment period may differ from the number of weeks or hours in the scheduled payment period used to determine the student9s grant amount for the payment period. Although a student9s completion of additional weeks or hours in a payment period has no effect on the scheduled payment periods for purposes of determining Pell Grant and TEACH Grant payment amounts, an undergraduate student who accelerates in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year of a program. Specifically, if a student enrolled in a program that is greater than one academic year in length completes additional clock or credit hours prior to the final academic year of the program, this may result in a final period of study that contains fewer clock or credit hours than the number of hours in the program9s defined academic year. In this circumstance, the Direct Loan annual loan limit for an undergraduate student must be prorated (reduced). The principles described above are illustrated by the examples in Appendix A at the end of this chapter. For guidance on calculating Pell Grant and TEACH Grant awards for clock-hour and non-term credit-hour programs, see Volume 7. For information on Direct Loan annual loan limit proration and annual loan limit progression in clock-hour and non-term credit- hour programs, see Volume 8, Chapters 5 and 6. If your school is unable to determine when a student has successfully completed half of the credit or clock hours in a program, academic year, or remainder of a program, the student is considered to have begun the second payment period of the program, academic year, or remainder of a program at the later of the date (identified by your school) that the student has successfully completed: half of the academic coursework in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program; or half of the number of weeks of instructional time in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program.', '<2-hop>\n\nDisbursement Timing in Subscription-Based Programs For the first two subscription periods (terms) that a student attends in a subscription-based program, there is no requirement for the student to have completed a certain amount of coursework before receiving a disbursement of Title IV funds (the same as in any other term-based program using credit hours). However, to receive a disbursement of Title IV aid for each subsequent subscription period in the program, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods in the program, excluding the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in the most recently attended subscription period. For more detailed guidance on the disbursement rules for subscription-based programs, including examples, refer to Appendix B at the end of this chapter. Multiple Disbursements Within a Payment Period The regulations governing the Title IV programs generally permit schools to pay Title IV funds at such times and in such installments within each payment period as will best meet students9 needs. This gives schools the ability to apportion the payment if doing so will be in the best interest of the student. For example, if a payment period is particularly long, a school might choose to pay in multiple installments to the extent program requirements permit to ensure that a student will have funds to pay rent later in the payment period. If a school chooses to schedule multiple Direct Loan disbursements within a single payment period, the disbursements must be substantially equal. Note also that if the loan period for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless the school qualifies for an exception to the multiple disbursement requirement. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more']","The disbursement timing requirements for federal student aid differ between clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs and subscription-based programs:

1. **Clock-hour or Non-term Credit-hour Programs:**
   - Disbursements are based on the student's successful completion of the hours and weeks of instructional time in a payment period.
   - A student must complete the coursework associated with the hours before receiving the next disbursement.
   - For programs with nonstandard terms, the same rules apply, requiring successful completion of hours and instructional weeks before disbursement.
   - The disbursement for the next payment period occurs only after the student has completed the current period's hours and weeks.

2. **Subscription-based Programs:**
   - A school can make a disbursement of Title IV funds up to 10 days before the beginning of the subscription period for the first two terms.
   - Starting with the third subscription period, disbursement before the period begins is only permitted if the student has completed the required credit hours for that period.
   - If the student has not completed the required coursework, disbursement is delayed until the coursework completion requirement is met.

In summary, clock-hour and non-term programs require successful coursework completion before each disbursement, whereas subscription-based programs allow early disbursement (up to 10 days before the period) for initial terms, with later disbursements contingent on coursework completion.","In clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs, students must complete both the required credit or clock hours and weeks of instructional time in a payment period before receiving a disbursement of Pell Grant, FSEOG, TEACH Grant, or Direct Loan funds for the next payment period.

For the Direct Loan Program only, this same requirement applies to students who are enrolled in programs with nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length. Effect of Accelerated Progression on Disbursement Timing in a Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Program The Pell Grant or TEACH Grant amount that a student is eligible to receive for a payment period in a clock-hour or non- term credit-hour program is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods for the program that are established at the beginning of the program based on the program length (as described earlier in this chapter). These scheduled payment periods do not change, regardless of a student9s rate of progression through a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program. This means that if a student completes additional weeks of instructional time or hours while completing the other measure of a payment period, the actual number of weeks or hours that the student completes before a disbursement can be made for the next payment period may differ from the number of weeks or hours in the scheduled payment period used to determine the student9s grant amount for the payment period. Although a student9s completion of additional weeks or hours in a payment period has no effect on the scheduled payment periods for purposes of determining Pell Grant and TEACH Grant payment amounts, an undergraduate student who accelerates in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year of a program. Specifically, if a student enrolled in a program that is greater than one academic year in length completes additional clock or credit hours prior to the final academic year of the program, this may result in a final period of study that contains fewer clock or credit hours than the number of hours in the program9s defined academic year. In this circumstance, the Direct Loan annual loan limit for an undergraduate student must be prorated (reduced). The principles described above are illustrated by the examples in Appendix A at the end of this chapter. For guidance on calculating Pell Grant and TEACH Grant awards for clock-hour and non-term credit-hour programs, see Volume 7. For information on Direct Loan annual loan limit proration and annual loan limit progression in clock-hour and non-term credit- hour programs, see Volume 8, Chapters 5 and 6. If your school is unable to determine when a student has successfully completed half of the credit or clock hours in a program, academic year, or remainder of a program, the student is considered to have begun the second payment period of the program, academic year, or remainder of a program at the later of the date (identified by your school) that the student has successfully completed: half of the academic coursework in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program; or half of the number of weeks of instructional time in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program.', '<2-hop>\n\nDisbursement Timing in Subscription-Based Programs For the first two subscription periods (terms) that a student attends in a subscription-based program, there is no requirement for the student to have completed a certain amount of coursework before receiving a disbursement of Title IV funds (the same as in any other term-based program using credit hours). However, to receive a disbursement of Title IV aid for each subsequent subscription period in the program, the student must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended subscription periods in the program, excluding the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in the most recently attended subscription period. For more detailed guidance on the disbursement rules for subscription-based programs, including examples, refer to Appendix B at the end of this chapter. Multiple Disbursements Within a Payment Period The regulations governing the Title IV programs generally permit schools to pay Title IV funds at such times and in such installments within each payment period as will best meet students9 needs. This gives schools the ability to apportion the payment if doing so will be in the best interest of the student. For example, if a payment period is particularly long, a school might choose to pay in multiple installments to the extent program requirements permit to ensure that a student will have funds to pay rent later in the payment period. If a school chooses to schedule multiple Direct Loan disbursements within a single payment period, the disbursements must be substantially equal. Note also that if the loan period for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless the school qualifies for an exception to the multiple disbursement requirement. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more']","The examples in Appendix A and Appendix B illustrate the differences in disbursement timing and eligibility requirements for students in clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs versus subscription-based programs. 

For clock-hour and non-term credit-hour programs, disbursements are tied to the successful completion of specific hours and weeks of instruction. The payment periods are defined based on the student's progress in completing the required clock hours or weeks, and disbursements are made after the student has successfully completed these milestones. This means that disbursement timing is directly linked to the student's coursework completion.

In contrast, for subscription-based programs, there is no requirement for students to have completed a specific amount of coursework before receiving the first two disbursement periods. However, for subsequent periods, disbursements depend on the student's cumulative credit hours completed across all previous subscription periods. The eligibility for later disbursements is based on the student's progress in accumulating credit hours over time, rather than the completion of specific coursework in a given period.

Overall, clock-hour and non-term programs require students to meet specific coursework completion criteria before disbursement, while subscription-based programs offer more initial flexibility, with later disbursements contingent on cumulative progress.","The examples in Appendix A illustrate the principles of disbursement timing and eligibility for Pell Grant, TEACH Grant, and Direct Loan funds in clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs, including how accelerated progression can affect Direct Loan annual loan limit proration in the final academic year. In contrast, Appendix B provides detailed guidance and examples on the disbursement rules for subscription-based programs, specifically showing that while the first two subscription periods do not require completion of coursework before disbursement, subsequent periods require students to have completed a cumulative number of credit hours based on prior enrollment. Thus, Appendix A and Appendix B demonstrate the distinct requirements and timing for disbursements in these different program structures.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer,"[None, 'StudentAid_Federal_Search', 'ask_naive_llm_tool']",10

This may be due to constraints imposed by outside licensing bodies or the need to accommodate schedules of entities with which students are being placed (e.g., school districts or hospitals); and Credit hours associated with the practicum or clinical experience must be associated with the term in which most of the training occurs, even if the starting and ending dates do not exactly align with the term dates and/or overlap with another term. If the clinical work meets all the above criteria, terms which include such clinical work are not required to be considered nonstandard, nor are such programs required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. This flexibility is limited to required clinical periods associated with standard term programs in medicine (including, but not limited to, allopathic, osteopathic, nursing, veterinary, dentistry, pharmacy, and physical therapy), and student teaching required to obtain a state teaching certificate. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for additional guidance on certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets the criteria described above is included in a standard term. Nonstandard Terms Generally, nonstandard terms are terms that are not semesters, trimesters, or quarters. For example, a 5-week term or a 23-week term would be considered a nonstandard term because no standard term can be fewer than nine weeks or greater than 21 weeks in length. Like standard terms, nonstandard terms may be equal in length or may be of different lengths. If a program is offered in a combination of standard terms and nonstandard terms, the program is considered to be offered in nonstandard terms. Also, like standard terms, nonstandard terms may not overlap within a program. Even if a school calls its terms semesters, trimesters, or quarters, they are considered to be nonstandard terms if they do not comply with the policy on standard term length, as described earlier. For instance, a 22-week semester or an 8-week quarter must be treated as a nonstandard term, because a semester cannot contain more than 21 weeks and a quarter must include a minimum of nine weeks. Semesters, trimesters, or quarters are also considered to be nonstandard terms if academic progress is not measured in the manner normally associated with the type of term. For example, if a program is offered in 15-week semesters but measures academic progress in quarter credit hours, the semesters would be considered nonstandard terms.']","The disbursement timing rules for Title IV funds in subscription-based programs specify that funds are disbursed monthly. Typically, 75% of cases are resolved within 50 days, and 90% within 90 days. Contractors involved in disbursement must coordinate any system changes five business days in advance, with emergency changes requiring immediate notification.

Regarding Volume 8, Chapter 3, it provides guidance for clinical work related to the operations of Next Gen BPO providers. It emphasizes the importance of responding to client inquiries, processing student aid tasks using standardized methods, and providing contact center support. The chapter also highlights the need for training, compliance with FSA guidelines, and collaboration with FSA or designated partners to suggest process improvements and implement changes.","For the first two subscription periods in a subscription-based program, students do not need to complete a certain amount of coursework before receiving Title IV disbursements. For later periods, students must have completed a cumulative number of credit hours equal to all previously attended periods, excluding the most recent one.

In a standard term or nonstandard term academic calendar, a term is generally a period in which all classes are scheduled to begin and end within a set time frame, and academic progress is measured in credit hours. In a non-term academic calendar, classes do not begin and end within a set time frame, such as a term. Academic progress in a non-term program can be measured in either credit or clock hours. In some cases (as discussed below), a program with terms must be treated as a non-term program for Title IV purposes. A subscription-based academic calendar is used only by subscription-based programs. A subscription-based program is a term-based program in which the school charges a student for each term on a subscription basis with the expectation that the student will complete a specified number of credit hours (or the equivalent) during that term. However, classes in a subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term, as is the case in a term-based calendar that is not subscription-based. For more detail on subscription-based programs, see Volume 2, Chapter 2. A subscription-based academic calendar consists of ""subscription periods"" that are either standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms (for guidance on when terms are considered to be substantially equal in length, see <Payment periods for programs using standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms= later in this chapter). Substantially equal nonstandard terms may be of any length, but if they are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for purposes of monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6 for more information on BBAY 3). Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length are not permissible in a subscription-based academic calendar. The term ""subscription period"" is synonymous with ""term"" and ""payment period"" (payment periods are covered later in this chapter). Except for the fact that classes are not required to start and end within a term, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs. These requirements include: minimum and maximum term length restrictions for standard terms (see the discussion in the next section of this chapter); requirements for determining full-time enrollment (see Volume 1, Chapter 1); use of a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY), BBAY 1, BBAY 2, or BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6); and use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards (see Volume 7, Chapter 4). Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. Standard Terms: Semesters, Trimesters, and Quarters Semesters and trimesters contain between 14 and 21 weeks of instructional time. However, a summer term in a program using semesters or trimesters may contain fewer than 14 weeks. An academic calendar that uses semesters or trimesters traditionally has three terms, one each in the fall, spring, and summer, two of which comprise an academic year. For example, in a program using an SAY calendar, fall and spring would comprise an academic year.

It also covers the inclusion of clinical work in terms, especially when clinical work meets certain criteria to be included in a standard term or a nonstandard term that is substantially equal and at least nine weeks long (SE9W). The chapter explains that clinical work conducted outside the classroom, such as medical and education program work, can be included in a standard or SE9W nonstandard term if specific requirements are met, and discusses exceptions to normal loan period and disbursement rules related to clinical work.

Volume 8 Chapter 3 provides guidance on exceptions to the normal loan periods and disbursement rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets certain criteria is included in a standard term. It explains that for clinical work to be included in a standard or SE9W nonstandard term, the clinical work must meet specific criteria, and if clinical work begins before the start date of the associated term, the loan period start date is the beginning date of the clinical work rather than the term. The chapter emphasizes the importance of associating clinical work with the appropriate term during which the majority of the clinical work occurs.

In summary, both chapters address how nonstandard terms are defined and how clinical work programs are incorporated into these terms, including specific rules and exceptions for loan periods and disbursements related to clinical work.","volume 8 chapter 6 is mentioned as giving more information on BBAY 3, which is used for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression in subscription-based programs with nonstandard terms that are not at least nine weeks in length. volume 8 chapter 3 is referenced for additional guidance on exceptions to normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets certain criteria is included in a standard term. both chapters provide details on how nonstandard terms affect Direct Loan rules, with chapter 6 focusing on subscription-based programs and BBAY 3, and chapter 3 addressing exceptions for clinical work in standard term programs.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer,"[None, 'ask_naive_llm_tool']",5

For the Direct Loan Program only, this same requirement applies to students who are enrolled in programs with nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length. Effect of Accelerated Progression on Disbursement Timing in a Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Program The Pell Grant or TEACH Grant amount that a student is eligible to receive for a payment period in a clock-hour or non- term credit-hour program is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods for the program that are established at the beginning of the program based on the program length (as described earlier in this chapter). These scheduled payment periods do not change, regardless of a student9s rate of progression through a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program. This means that if a student completes additional weeks of instructional time or hours while completing the other measure of a payment period, the actual number of weeks or hours that the student completes before a disbursement can be made for the next payment period may differ from the number of weeks or hours in the scheduled payment period used to determine the student9s grant amount for the payment period. Although a student9s completion of additional weeks or hours in a payment period has no effect on the scheduled payment periods for purposes of determining Pell Grant and TEACH Grant payment amounts, an undergraduate student who accelerates in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final academic year of a program. Specifically, if a student enrolled in a program that is greater than one academic year in length completes additional clock or credit hours prior to the final academic year of the program, this may result in a final period of study that contains fewer clock or credit hours than the number of hours in the program9s defined academic year. In this circumstance, the Direct Loan annual loan limit for an undergraduate student must be prorated (reduced). The principles described above are illustrated by the examples in Appendix A at the end of this chapter. For guidance on calculating Pell Grant and TEACH Grant awards for clock-hour and non-term credit-hour programs, see Volume 7. For information on Direct Loan annual loan limit proration and annual loan limit progression in clock-hour and non-term credit- hour programs, see Volume 8, Chapters 5 and 6. If your school is unable to determine when a student has successfully completed half of the credit or clock hours in a program, academic year, or remainder of a program, the student is considered to have begun the second payment period of the program, academic year, or remainder of a program at the later of the date (identified by your school) that the student has successfully completed: half of the academic coursework in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program; or half of the number of weeks of instructional time in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program.', '<2-hop>\n\nnon-term (includes clock-hour calendars), or subscription-based.

Substantially equal nonstandard terms may be of any length, but if they are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use BBAY 3 for purposes of monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6 for more information on BBAY 3). Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length are not permissible in a subscription-based academic calendar. The term ""subscription period"" is synonymous with ""term"" and ""payment period"" (payment periods are covered later in this chapter). Except for the fact that classes are not required to start and end within a term, the rules and requirements for term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs. These requirements include: minimum and maximum term length restrictions for standard terms (see the discussion in the next section of this chapter); requirements for determining full-time enrollment (see Volume 1, Chapter 1); use of a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY), BBAY 1, BBAY 2, or BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6); and use of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards (see Volume 7, Chapter 4). Whether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for how aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs. Standard Terms: Semesters, Trimesters, and Quarters Semesters and trimesters contain between 14 and 21 weeks of instructional time. However, a summer term in a program using semesters or trimesters may contain fewer than 14 weeks. An academic calendar that uses semesters or trimesters traditionally has three terms, one each in the fall, spring, and summer, two of which comprise an academic year. For example, in a program using an SAY calendar, fall and spring would comprise an academic year. In a program using a']","The requirements for Pell Grant disbursement and calculation differ between clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs and subscription-based academic calendars as follows:

**Clock-hour or Non-term Credit-hour Programs:**
- Pell Grants for these programs use a Base Year Award (BBAY) and Formula 4 for calculation.
- A minimum 30-week academic year is required.
- Satisfactory academic progress must be maintained.
- Disbursement is based on the student's enrollment in clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs, which are often more flexible and continuous.

**Subscription-based Academic Calendars:**
- Pell Grant disbursement follows the specific academic calendar schedule of the institution.
- The exact requirements for disbursement are not detailed on the federal website and are typically determined by the college's financial aid office.
- These programs may not have a fixed minimum duration like clock-hour programs and can vary widely.

**Implications for Payment Periods and Academic Progress Measurement:**
- For clock-hour/non-term programs, payment periods are often aligned with the 30-week minimum and progress is measured based on satisfactory academic progress standards applicable to these programs.
- For subscription-based calendars, payment periods are tied to the institution's academic calendar, which may be semester, quarter, or other formats, and progress is assessed according to the institution's policies.
- The differences impact how students qualify for disbursements, how often they receive funds, and how their academic progress is monitored for continued eligibility.

For precise details tailored to your specific program and institution, it is recommended to contact your college's financial aid office.","In clock-hour or non-term credit-hour programs, Pell Grant disbursement is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods established at the beginning of the program. These scheduled payment periods do not change regardless of a student's rate of progression, meaning that even if a student completes additional weeks or hours, the payment periods used to determine Pell Grant amounts remain fixed. Academic progress in these programs is measured by the completion of credit or clock hours and weeks of instructional time, and disbursement for the next payment period cannot occur until both measures are met. In contrast, subscription-based academic calendars are term-based but do not require classes to begin or end within a specific timeframe for each term. Instead, students are charged on a subscription basis with the expectation of completing a specified number of credit hours per term. Payment periods in subscription-based programs are synonymous with 'subscription periods' or 'terms,' and Pell Grant awards are calculated using Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3, depending on the program structure. The type of academic calendar—whether standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based—affects how aid is awarded and disbursed, as well as how academic progress is measured for Title IV purposes.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer,"[None, 'StudentAid_Federal_Search']",10
